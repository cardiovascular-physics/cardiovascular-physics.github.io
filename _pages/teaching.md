        <h2> Computational Biosignal analysis 1 </h2>
        <p>An introductory course to biosignal processing. The course focuses on: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Data collection and preprocessing</li>
            <li>Spectral analysis</li>
            <li>Filters</li>
            <li>Probability and statistical tests</li>
            <li>Descriptive models</li>
            <li>Biosignals: Brain, Lungs and Cardiovascular System</li>
            <li>Prediction of diseases</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The course also includes a session where sutdents can record their own biosignals and analyze them. The course consists of 1 Lecture and 1 Seminar per week.</p>
