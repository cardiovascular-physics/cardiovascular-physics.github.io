	abstract = {Health is one of the most important non-material assets and thus also has an enormous influence on material values, since treating and preventing diseases is  expensive. The number one cause of death worldwide today originates in  cardiovascular diseases. For these reasons the aim of understanding the functions  and the interactions of the cardiovascular system is and has been a major  research topic throughout various disciplines for more than a hundred years. The  purpose of most of today's research is to get as much information as possible  with the lowest possible effort and the least discomfort for the subject or  patient, e.g. via non-invasive measurements. A family of tools whose importance  has been growing during the last years is known under the headline of coupling  measures. The rationale for this kind of analysis is to identify the structure of  interactions in a system of multiple components. Important information lies for  example in the coupling direction, the coupling strength, and occurring time  lags. In this work, we will, after a brief general introduction covering the  development of cardiovascular time series analysis, introduce, explain and review  some of the most important coupling measures and classify them according to their  origin and capabilities in the light of physiological analyses. We will begin  with classical correlation measures, go via Granger-causality-based tools,  entropy-based techniques (e.g. momentary information transfer), nonlinear  prediction measures (e.g. mutual prediction) to symbolic dynamics (e.g. symbolic  coupling traces). All these methods have contributed important insights into  physiological interactions like cardiorespiratory coupling, neuro-cardio-coupling  and many more. Furthermore, we will cover tools to detect and analyze  synchronization and coordination (e.g. synchrogram and coordigram). As a last  point we will address time dependent couplings as identified using a recent  approach employing ensembles of time series. The scope of this review, as opposed  to various other excellent reviews like (Hlaváčková-Schindler et al Phys. Rep.  441 1-46, Kramer et al 2004 Phys. Rev. E 70 1-10, Lombardi 2000 Circulation 101  8-10, Porta et al 2000 Am. J. Physiol.: Heart and Circulatory Physiol. 279  H2558-67, Schelter et al 2006 J. Neurosci. Methods 152 210-9), is to give a  broader overview over existing coupling measures and where to look to find the  most appropriate tool for a given situation. The review will comprise a test of  one representative of the most important coupling measure groups using a simple  toy model to illustrate some essential features of the tools. At the end we will  summarise the performance of each measure and offer some advice on when to use  which method.},

RCC found during work-up of a transplant candidate needs  treatment and to limit the risk of recurrence usually a mandatory observation  period before transplantation is recommended. An observation period may be  omitted for candidates with incidentally discovered and excised small RCCs  ({\textless}3 cm). Likewise, RCC in the donor organ may not always preclude usage if tumor  is small ({\textless}2 to 4 cm) and removed with clear margins before transplantation.  After transplantation, 90\% of RCCs are detected in the native kidneys,  particularly if acquired cystic kidney disease has developed during prolonged  dialysis. Screening for RCC after transplantation has not been found  cost-effective. Treatment of RCC in KTRs poses challenges with adjustments of  immunosuppression and oncologic treatments. For localized RCC, excision or  nephrectomy is often curative. For metastatic RCC, recent landmark trials in the  nontransplanted population demonstrate that immunotherapy combinations improve  survival. Dedicated trials in KTRs are lacking. Case series on immune checkpoint  inhibitors in solid organ recipients with a range of cancer types indicate  partial or complete tumor response in approximately one-third of the patients at  the cost of rejection developing in {\textasciitilde}40\%.},

	abstract = {Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), a heterogeneous and multifactorial sleep related breathing disorder with high prevalence, is a recognized risk factor for  cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Autonomic dysfunction leads to adverse  cardiovascular outcomes in diverse pathways. Heart rate is a complex  physiological process involving neurovisceral networks and relative regulatory  mechanisms such as thermoregulation, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone mechanisms,  and metabolic mechanisms. Heart rate variability (HRV) is considered as a  reliable and non-invasive measure of autonomic modulation response and adaptation  to endogenous and exogenous stimuli. HRV measures may add a new dimension to help  understand the interplay between cardiac and nervous system involvement in OSA.  The aim of this review is to introduce the various applications of HRV in  different aspects of OSA to examine the impaired neuro-cardiac modulation. More  specifically, the topics covered include: HRV time windows, sleep staging,  arousal, sleepiness, hypoxia, mental illness, and mortality and morbidity. All of  these aspects show pathways in the clinical implementation of HRV to screen,  diagnose, classify, and predict patients as a reasonable and more convenient  alternative to current measures.},

	abstract = {The number of patients suffering from cardiovascular diseases increases unproportionally high with the increase of the human population and aging,  leading to very high expenses in the public health system. Therefore, the  challenge of cardiovascular physics is to develop high-sophisticated methods  which are able to, on the one hand, supplement and replace expensive medical  devices and, on the other hand, improve the medical diagnostics with decreasing  the patient's risk. Cardiovascular physics-which interconnects medicine, physics,  biology, engineering, and mathematics-is based on interdisciplinary collaboration  of specialists from the above scientific fields and attempts to gain deeper  insights into pathophysiology and treatment options. This paper summarizes  advances in cardiovascular physics with emphasis on a workshop held in Bad  Honnef, Germany, in May 2005. The meeting attracted an interdisciplinary audience  and led to a number of papers covering the main research fields of cardiovascular  physics, including data analysis, modeling, and medical application. The variety  of problems addressed by this issue underlines the complexity of the  cardiovascular system. It could be demonstrated in this Focus Issue, that data  analyses and modeling methods from cardiovascular physics have the ability to  lead to significant improvements in different medical fields. Consequently, this  Focus Issue of Chaos is a status report that may invite all interested readers to  join the community and find competent discussion and cooperation partners.},

	abstract = {Cardiorespiratory phase synchronisation (CRS) is a type of cardiorespiratory coupling that manifests through a prediliction for heart beats to occur at  specific points relative to the phase of the respiratory cycle. It has been under  investigation for nearly 20 years, and while it seems to be mostly occurring in  relaxed states such as deep sleep and anesthesia, no clear clinical implications  have been established. Cardiorespiratory coordination (CRC) is a recent  development in this field where the relationship between the respiratory onset  and heart beat is analysed in the time domain and the possible relationship of  each heart beat is considered for both the previous and the next respiratory  onset. This ostensibly closely related effect must not only show relevant  information content but also do so independent of CRS in order to be relevant for  future studies. In this paper, we investigate CRC and its relation to CRS mainly  using graphical and statistical methods on two exemplary datasets: measurements  from a pregnant woman participating in a preeclampsia study and those from a man  suffering from sleep apnea. We show fundamental differences between the results  of both approaches and are able to show a formerly unknown dependency between the  heart activity and respiratory rate, potentially indicating heartbeat-initiated  inspiration. Despite their differences, methods developed for the quantification  of CRS can be adapted to CRC. Completing the comparison is an investigation into  the relationship between CRC and respiratory sinus arrhythmia. Similar to  previous results for CRS, the two effects are found to be orthogonal, meaning  that they can be observed independently or in conjunction.},

Using a corpus including 927  measurements of pregnant women with and without different hypertonic diseases at  multiple stages of pregnancy, we utilised a new approach to analyse  cardiorespiratory coordination. Since the recording quality of respiratory effort  was limited due to a high signal to noise ratio, we applied an ECG derived  respiration approach to create an ersatz respiratory signal. After applying the  few available recordings with a sufficiently high quality of the respiratory  signal to validate the substitute, coordigrams were calculated and quantified by  utilising an epsilon method. We showed significant (p  {\textless}  0.05) differences in  the coordination in a matched (BMI, age, gestational week) comparison of  preeclamptic and healthy subjects. Hopefully future applications of and  improvements on these methods are able to create a fast and convenient prediction  methodology to reduce the impact of this disease as well as help in the  determination of its underlying cause.},

Here, we report for the first time in the Bay of  Biscay, North-East Atlantic, the body composition in various biological  parameters and chemical elements of a meso-to bathypelagic micronektonic  community. Stable carbon and nitrogen isotope compositions (δ(13)C, δ(15)N), C:N  ratios, energy density, as well as the concentrations in 6 macro-minerals and 13  trace elements including essential (micro-nutrients) and non-essential elements  (undesirables, with no know biological function) were measured in whole organisms  of 4 crustacean and 11 fish species caught simultaneously around 800 m depth. The  results showed a low variability of δ(13)C values, confirming that all studied  species share the same habitat. On the contrary, large differences were observed  among species for several elements. Trace elements showed the greatest  variability (i.e. larger range of values), especially silver (Ag), arsenic (As),  cadmium (Cd), cobalt and vanadium. Significant differences were also revealed  among taxa for Ag, As, Cd, copper and strontium concentrations (with  crustaceans {\textgreater} fish), as well as for δ(15)N values and phosphorus concentrations  (with fish {\textgreater} crustaceans). Although concentrations varied greatly among species,  they could be grouped according to their energy density and composition in 19  chemical elements, through hierarchical clustering analysis. Six functional  groups of species have been thus identified, reflecting contrasted nutritional  benefit and/or exposure to undesirables for predators feeding on this deep  pelagic community. Finally, the concentrations measured for the potentially toxic  trace elements (undesirables) exceeded the existing European thresholds for Cd  and to a lesser extent mercury (Hg), which point out potential risks in the  perspective of a future exploitation of these deep living resources by humans.},

	abstract = {AIMS: Chronic exposure to nocturnal transportation noise has been linked to cardiovascular disorders with sleep impairment as the main mediator. Here we  examined whether nocturnal transportation noise affects the main stress pathways,  and whether it relates to changes in the macro and micro structure of sleep.  METHODS AND RESULTS: Twenty-six young healthy participants (12 women, 24.6 ± 0.7  years, mean ± SE) spent five consecutive 24-h days and one last morning in the  laboratory. The first (baseline) and last (recovery) nights comprised a quiet  ambient scenario. In-between, four different noise scenarios (low/medium/high  intermittent road or rail scenarios with an identical equivalent continuous sound  level of 45 dB) were randomly presented during the 8-h nights. Participants felt  more annoyed from the transportation noise scenarios compared to the quiet  ambient scenario played back during the baseline and recovery nights  (F(5,117) = 10.2, p {\textless} 0.001). Nocturnal transportation noise did not  significantly impact polysomnographically assessed sleep macrostructure, blood  pressure, nocturnal catecholamine levels and morning cytokine levels. Evening  cortisol levels increased after sleeping with highly intermittent road noise  compared to baseline (p = 0.002, noise effect: F(4,83) = 4.0, p = 0.005), a  result related to increased cumulative duration of autonomic arousals during the  noise nights (F(5,106) = 3.4, p {\textless} 0.001; correlation: r(pearson) = 0.64,  p = 0.006). CONCLUSION: Under controlled laboratory conditions, highly  intermittent nocturnal road noise exposure at 45 dB increased the cumulative  duration of autonomic arousals during sleep and next-day evening cortisol levels.  Our results indicate that, without impairing sleep macrostructure, nocturnal  transportation noise of 45 dB is a physiological stressor that affects the  hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis during the following day in healthy young  good sleepers.},

As complements to EEG, EOG, and EMG, these signals provide  diagnostic information for autonomic nervous activity during sleep. This review  presents major methodological developments in sleep research regarding heart  rate, ECG, and cardio-respiratory couplings in a chronological (historical)  sequence. It presents physiological and pathophysiological insights related to  sleep medicine obtained by new technical developments. Recorded nocturnal ECG  facilitates conventional heart rate variability (HRV) analysis, studies of  cyclical variations of heart rate, and analysis of ECG waveform. In healthy  adults, the autonomous nervous system is regulated in totally different ways  during wakefulness, slow-wave sleep, and REM sleep. Analysis of beat-to-beat  heart-rate variations with statistical methods enables us to estimate sleep  stages based on the differences in autonomic nervous system regulation.  Furthermore, up to some degree, it is possible to track transitions from  wakefulness to sleep by analysis of heart-rate variations. ECG and heart rate  analysis allow assessment of selected sleep disorders as well. Sleep disordered  breathing can be detected reliably by studying cyclical variation of heart rate  combined with respiration-modulated changes in ECG morphology (amplitude of R  wave and T wave).},

Based on recordings of brain waves and the analysis of  characteristic patterns and waveforms it is possible to distinguish wakefulness  and five sleep stages. Sleep and the sleep stages modulate autonomous nervous  system functions such as body temperature, respiration, blood pressure, and heart  rate. These functions consist of a sympathetic tone usually related to activation  and to parasympathetic (or vagal) tone usually related to inhibition. Methods of  statistical physics are used to analyze heart rate and respiration to detect  changes of the autonomous nervous system during sleep. Detrended fluctuation  analysis and synchronization analysis and their applications to heart rate and  respiration during sleep in healthy subjects and patients with sleep disorders  are presented. The observed changes can be used to distinguish sleep stages in  healthy subjects as well as to differentiate normal and disturbed sleep on the  basis of heart rate and respiration recordings without direct recording of brain  waves. Of special interest are the cardiovascular consequences of disturbed sleep  because they present a risk factor for cardiovascular disorders such as arterial  hypertension, cardiac ischemia, sudden cardiac death, and stroke. New derived  variables can help to find indicators for these health risks.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The REACT DX registry evaluates standard therapies to episodes of long-lasting atrial tachyarrhythmias and assesses the quality of sensing and  stability of the lead and the implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD)  (BIOTRONIK Lumax VR-T DX and successors) over at least a 1-year follow-up period.  OBJECTIVE: To study the association between the risk of de novo device-detected  atrial fibrillation (AF), the autonomic perturbations before the onset of  paroxysmal AF and a 7-days heart rate variability (7dHRV) 1 month after ICD  implantation. METHODS: The registry consists of 234 patients implanted with an  ICD, including 10 with de novo long-lasting atrial tachyarrhythmias with no prior  history of AF. The patients were matched via the propensity-score methodology as  well as for properties directly influencing the ECGs recorded using GE CardioMem  CM 3000. Heart rate variability (HRV) analysis was performed using standard  parameters from time- and frequency-domains, and from non-linear dynamics.  RESULTS: No linear HRV was associated with an increased risk of AF (p = n.s.).  The only significant approach was derived from symbolic dynamics with the  parameter "forbidden words" which distinguished both groups on all 7 days of  measurements (p {\textless} 0.05), thereby quantifying the heart rate complexity (HRC) as  drastically lower in the de novo AF group. CONCLUSION: Cardiac autonomic  dysfunction denoted by low HRC may be associated with higher AF incidence. For  patients with mild to moderate heart failure, standard HRV parameters are not  appropriate to quantify cardiac autonomic perturbations before the onset of AF.  Further studies are needed to determine the individual risk for AF that would  enable interventions to restore autonomic balance in the general population.},

Specific monitoring of depth of  hypnosis and depth of analgesia based on heart rate variability (HRV) analysis is  eligible to improve patient safety and reduce efforts in post-operative care.  Consequently, in this analysis we assess the applicability of HRV parameters  during surgical interventions with standardized intravenous  propofol-remifentanil-anaesthesia. Peri-operative electrocardiograms were  recorded from cardiovascular stable patients (ASA Score I/II, N = 32, age: 36.4 ±  11.23 a, BMI: 25.2 ± 3.16) scheduled for trauma and dentofacial surgery. HRV  time- and frequency-domain parameters, measures of complexity and nonlinear  dynamics were compared by analysing longitudinally distributed 300 s intervals  preceding/following induction of anaesthesia (BL-I1), intubation (I1-I2) and  extubation (E1-E2). Mean value (meanNN) and standard deviation (sdNN) of the  heart rate are influenced in BL-I1 (p {\textless} 0.001), I1-I2 (p {\textless} 0.05) and E1-E2 (p {\textless}  0.001). The number of forbidden words of symbolic dynamics changes significantly  for BL-I1 (p {\textless} 0.001) and not for I1-I2 and E1-E2 (p {\textgreater} 0.05). Probability of  low-variability POLVAR10 is significantly altered in all comparisons (BL-I1: Δ =  0.032, p {\textless} 0.01, I1-I2: Δ = 0.12, p {\textless} 0.05, E1-E2: Δ = 0.169, p {\textless} 0.01) but  especially during nociception. While standard time-domain parameters lacked  selectivity, parameters of symbolic dynamics appear to be specifically influenced  by changes in depth of hypnosis and nociception, respectively. However, the lack  of steady-state ventilation/breathing in this study needs to be considered in  future research. To be used for clinical anaesthesia monitoring our results have  to be prospectively validated in clinical studies.},

	abstract = {Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in adults worldwide. There is one common pathophysiological aspect present in all  cardiovascular diseases-dysfunctional heart rhythm regulation. Taking this aspect  into consideration for cardiovascular risk predictions opens important research  perspectives, allowing for the development of preventive treatment techniques.  The aim of this study was to find out whether certain pathologically appearing  signs in the heart rate variability (HRV) of an apparently healthy person, even  with high HRV, can be defined as biomarkers for a disturbed cardiac regulation  and whether this can be treated preventively by a drug-free method. This  multi-phase study included 218 healthy subjects of either sex, who consecutively  visited the physician at Gesundheit clinic because of arterial hypertension,  depression, headache, psycho-emotional stress, extreme weakness, disturbed night  sleep, heart palpitations, or chest pain. In study phase A, baseline measurement  to identify individuals with cardiovascular risks was done. Therefore, standard  HRV, as well as the new cardiorhythmogram (CRG) method, were applied to all  subjects. The new CRG analysis used here is based on the recently introduced LF  drops and HF counter-regulation. Regarding the mechanisms of why these appear in  a steady-state cardiorhythmmogram, they represent non-linear event-based  dynamical HRV biomarkers. The next phase of the study, phase B, tested whether  the pathologically appearing signs identified via CRG in phase A could be  clinically influenced by drug-free treatment. In order to validate the new CRG  method, it was supported by non-linear HRV analysis in both phase A and in phase  B. Out of 218 subjects, the pathologically appearing signs could be detected in  130 cases (60\%), p {\textless} 0.01, by the new CRG method, and by the standard HRV  analysis in 40 cases (18\%), p {\textless} 0.05. Thus, the CRG method was able to detect 42\%  more cases with pathologically appearing cardiac regulation. In addition, the  comparative CRG analysis before and after treatment showed that the  pathologically appearing signs could be clinically influenced without the use of  medication. After treatment, the risk group decreased eight-fold-from 130 people  to 16 (p {\textless} 0.01). Therefore, progression of the detected pathological signs to  structural cardiac pathology or arrhythmia could be prevented in most of the  cases. However, in the remaining risk group of 16 apparently healthy subjects, 8  people died due to all-cause mortality. In contrast, no other subject in this  study has died so far. The non-linear parameter which is able to quantify the  changes in CRGs before versus after treatment is FWRENYI4 (symbolic dynamic  feature); it decreased from 2.85 to 2.53 (p {\textless} 0.001). In summary, signs of  pathological cardiac regulation can be identified by the CRG analysis of  apparently healthy subjects in the early stages of development of cardiac  pathology. Thus, our method offers a sensitive biomarker for cardiovascular  risks. The latter can be influenced by non-drug treatments (acupuncture) to stop  the progression into structural cardiac pathologies or arrhythmias in most but  not all of the patients. Therefore, this could be a real and easy-to-use  supplemental method, contributing to primary prevention in cardiology.},

Repetitive respiratory  disorders during sleep are assumed to be a major cause of these diseases.  Therefore, the understanding of the cardio-respiratory regulation during these  events is of high public interest. One of the governing mechanisms is the mutual  influence of the cardiac and respiratory oscillations on their respective onsets,  the cardio-respiratory coordination (CRC). We analyze this mechanism based on  nocturnal measurements of 27 males suffering from obstructive sleep apnea  syndrome. Here we find, by using an advanced analysis technique, the cardiogram,  not only that the occurrence of CRC is significantly more frequent during  respiratory sleep disturbances than in normal respiration (p-value{\textless}10(-51)) but  also more frequent after these events (p-value{\textless}10(-15)). Especially, the latter  finding contradicts the common assumption that spontaneous CRC can only be  observed in epochs of relaxed conditions, while our newly discovered epochs of  CRC after disturbances are characterized by high autonomic stress. Our findings  on the connection between CRC and the appearance of sleep-disordered events  require a substantial extension of the current understanding of obstructive sleep  apneas and hypopneas.},

For systems featuring various regimes, usually only the epochs before and after a  transition between different regimes are analyzed, although relevant information  might be hidden within these transitions. Transient behavior of cardiovascular  variables may emerge, on the one hand, from the recovery of the system after a  severe disturbance or, on the other hand, from adaptive behavior throughout  changes of states. It contains important information about the processes involved  and the relations between state variables such as heart rate, blood pressure, and  respiration. Therefore, we apply an ensemble approach to extend the method of  symbolic coupling traces to time-variant coupling analysis. These new ensemble  symbolic coupling traces are capable of determining coupling direction, strength,  and time offset τ from transient dynamics in multivariate cardiovascular data. We  use this method to analyze data recorded during an orthostatic test to reveal a  transient structure that cannot be detected by classic methods.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Sudden cardiac arrest is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide and remains a major public health problem for which better non-invasive  prediction tools are needed. Primary preventive therapies, such as implantable  cardioverter defibrillators, are not personalized and not predictive. Most of  these devices do not deliver life-saving therapy during their lifetime. The  individual relationship between fatal arrhythmias and cardiac function  abnormalities in predicting cardiac death risk has rarely been explored. METHODS:  We retrospectively analyzed the measurements at rest for 191 patients with acute  chest pain (ACP) magnetocardiographically. Our recently introduced analyses are  able to detect inhomogeneities of the depolarization and repolarization.  Moreover, electrically silent phenomena-intracellular ionic currents as well as  vortex currents-can be measured and quantified. All included ACP patients were  recruited in 2009 at Yonsei University Hospital and were followed up until 2022.  RESULTS: During half of the follow-up period (6.5 years), 11 patients died. Out  of all the included nine clinical, eight magnetocardiographical, and nine newly  introduced magnetoionographical parameters we tested in this study, three  parameters revealed themselves to be outstanding at predicting death: heart  rate-corrected QT (QTc) prolongation, depression of repolarization current  I(Kr) + I(Ks), and serum creatinine (all significant in Cox regression,  p {\textless} 0.05). They clearly predicted cardiac death over the 6.5 years duration  (sensitivity 90.9\%, specificity 85.6\%, negative predictive accuracy 99.4\%).  Cardiac death risk was more than ninefold higher in patients with low  repolarization reserve and QTc prolongation in comparison with the remaining  patients with ACP (p {\textless} 0.001). The non-parametric Kaplan-Meier statistics  estimated significantly lower survival functions from their lifetime data  (p {\textless} 0.001). DISCUSSION: To the best of our knowledge, these are the first data  linking magnetocardiographical and magnetoionographical parameters and subsequent  significant fatal events in people, suggesting structural and functional  components to clinical life-threatening ventricular arrhythmogenesis. The  findings support investigation of new prevention strategies and herald those new  non-invasive techniques as complementary risk stratification tools.},

As a  result, a broad substrate scope, including primary and secondary silanes, could  be converted to the desired products. The turnover performances of the catalyst  were also examined, yielding a maximum TOF of 4088 h(-1). New light was shed on  the debated mechanism of the interaction between [MnBr(CO)(5)] and Si-H bonds  based on the reaction kinetics (including KIEs of PhMe(2)SiD and D(2)O) and  spectroscopic techniques (FT-IR, GC-TCD, (1)H-, (29)Si-, and (13)C-NMR).

Despite a trend toward  increase with rising heart failure clinical severity, it was significantly  correlated with left ventricular ejection fraction and other echocardiographic  parameters. As shown for CNP before, NT-proCNP could not predict mortality and  heart transplant. Importantly, it had no statistical correlation with CNP.  Additionally, NEP activity was significantly increased in New York Heart  Association III and IV patients with HF but was positively correlated with CNP  concentration. Our data demonstrates that generation of CNP is not enhanced under  HF condition like CD. Thus, CNP rise by severe HF is caused by its less  degradation that is independent of NEP activity.},

Complexity, cost, and intrusiveness of overnight  polysomnography (PSG), the gold standard, have led to the search for alternative  tests. In this sense, the photoplethysmography signal (PPG) carries useful  information about the autonomous nervous activity associated to sleep stages and  can be easily acquired in pediatric sleep apnea home tests with a pulse oximeter.  In this study, we use the PPG signal along with convolutional neural networks  (CNN), a deep-learning technique, for the automatic identification of the three  main levels of sleep: wake (W), rapid eye movement (REM), and non-REM sleep. A  database of 366 PPG recordings from pediatric OSA patients is involved in the  study. A CNN architecture was trained using 30-s epochs from the PPG signal for  three-stage sleep classification. This model showed a promising diagnostic  performance in an independent test set, with 78.2\% accuracy and 0.57 Cohen's  kappa for W/NREM/REM classification. Furthermore, the percentage of time in wake  stage obtained for each subject showed no statistically significant differences  with the manually scored from PSG. These results were superior to the only  state-of-the-art study focused on the analysis of the PPG signal in the automated  detection of sleep stages in children suffering from OSA. This suggests that CNN  can be used along with PPG recordings for sleep stages scoring in pediatric home  sleep apnea tests.},

	abstract = {Spontaneous baroreflex sensitivity (BRS) is a widely used tool for the quantification of the cardiovascular regulation. Numerous groups use the xBRS  method, which calculates the cross-correlation between the systolic beat-to-beat  blood pressure and the R-R interval (resampled at 1 Hz) in a 10 s sliding window,  with 0-5 s delays for the interval. The delay with the highest correlation is  selected and, if significant, the quotient of the standard deviations of the R-R  intervals and the systolic blood pressures is recorded as the corresponding xBRS  value. In this paper we test the hypothesis that the xBRS method quantifies the  causal interactions of spontaneous BRS from non-invasive measurements at rest. We  use the term spontaneous BRS in the sense of the sensitivity curve is calculated  from non-interventional, i.e., spontaneous, baroreceptor activity. This study  includes retrospective analysis of 1828 measurements containing ECG as well as  continues blood pressure under resting conditions. Our results show a high  correlation between the heart rate - systolic blood pressure variability  (HRV/BPV) quotient and the xBRS (r = 0.94, p {\textless} 0.001). For a deeper understanding  we conducted two surrogate analyses by substituting the systolic blood pressure  by its reversed time series. These showed that the xBRS method was not able to  quantify causal relationships between the two signals. It was not possible to  distinguish between random and baroreflex controlled sequences. It appears xBRS  rather determines the HRV/BPV quotient. We conclude that the xBRS method has a  potentially large bias in characterizing the capacity of the arterial baroreflex  under resting conditions. During slow breathing, estimates for xBRS are  significantly increased, which clearly shows that measurements at rest only  involve limited baroreflex activity, but does neither challenge, nor show the  full range of the arterial baroreflex regulatory capacity. We show that xBRS is  exclusively dominated by the heart rate to systolic blood pressure ratio (r =  0.965, p {\textless} 0.001). Further investigations should focus on additional autonomous  testing procedures such as slow breathing or orthostatic testing to provide a  basis for a non-invasive evaluation of baroreflex sensitivity.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Myocarditis is a condition that can have severe adverse outcomes and lead to sudden cardiac death if remaining undetected. This study tested the  capability of cardiac magnetic field mapping to detect patients with clinically  suspected myocarditis. This could open up the way for rapid, non-invasive, and  cost-effective screening of suspected cases before a gold standard assessment via  endomyocardial biopsy. METHODS: Historical cardiac magnetic field maps (n = 97)  and data from a state-of-the-art magnetocardiography device (n = 30) were  analyzed using the Kullback-Leibler entropy (KLE) for dimensionality reduction  and topological quantification. Linear discriminant analysis was used to discern  between patients with ongoing myocarditis and healthy controls. RESULTS: The STT  segment of a magnetocardiogram, i.e., the section between the end of the S wave  and the end of the T wave, was best suited to discern both groups. Using a 250-ms  excerpt from the onset of the STT segment gave a reliable classification between  the myocarditis and control group for both historic data (sensitivity: 0.83,  specificity: 0.85, accuracy: 0.84) and recent data (sensitivity: 0.69,  specificity: 0.88, accuracy: 0.80) using the KLE to quantify the topology of the  cardiac magnetic field map. CONCLUSION: The implementation based on KLE can  reliably distinguish between clinically suspected myocarditis patients and  healthy controls. We implemented an automatized feature selection based on LDA to  replace the observer-dependent manual thresholding in previous studies.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To quantify and differentiate control and insomnia sleep onset patterns through biomedical signal processing of overnight polysomnograms.  METHODS: The approach consisted of three tandem modules: 1) biosignal processing  module, which used state-space time-varying autoregressive moving average  (TVARMA) processes with recursive particle filter, 2) hypnogram generation module  that implemented a fuzzy inference system (FIS), and 3) insomnia characterization  module that discriminated between control and subjects with insomnia using a  logistic regression model trained with a set of similarity measures ( d1, d2 ,  d3, d4). The study employed sleep onset periods from 16 control and 16 subjects  with insomnia. RESULTS: State-spaced TVARMA processes with recursive particle  filtering provided resilience to nonlinear, nonstationary, and non-Gaussian  conditions of biosignals. FIS managed automated sleep scoring robust to  intersubjects' and interraters' variability. The similarity distances quantified  in a scalar measure the transitions amongst sleep onset stages, computed from  expert and automated hypnograms. A statistical set of unpaired two-tailed t  -tests suggested that distances d1 , d2, and d3 had larger statistical  significance ( ) to characterize sleeping patterns. The logistic regression model  classified control and subjects with insomnia with sensitivity 87 \% , specificity  75 \%, and accuracy 81 \%. CONCLUSION: Our approach can perform a supportive role  in either biosignal processing, sleep staging, insomnia characterization, or all  the previous, coping with time-consuming procedures and massive data volumes of  standard protocols. SIGNIFICANCE: The introduction of graph spectral theory and  logistic regression for the diagnosis of insomnia represents a novel concept,  attempting to describe complex sleep dynamics throughout transitions networks and  scalar measures.},

Five minutes R-R time series were assessed every hour up to +12 h  and + 24 h post-LPS injection. We found that SD indices showed significant  differences at +7 h between V vs. LPS groups and at +9 h between basal levels of  LPS (-3 h) and post-LPS injection (pre-LPS vs. post-LPS). In general, SD seems  more appropriate than linear indices to evaluate the autonomic changes of  endotoxemic rats. Overall, the symbolic parameters detected decreased R-R  variability and complexity, which indicate a modification of the autonomic  regulation during LPS-induced endotoxemia.

To obtain large quantities of C1INH, recombinant human C1INH  (rhC1INH) was expressed in the milk of transgenic rabbits (12 g/l) harboring  genomic human C1INH sequences fused to 5' bovine αS(1) casein promoter sequences.  Recombinant hC1INH was isolated from milk to a specific activity of 6.1 U/mg and  a purity of 99\%; by size-exclusion chromatography the 1\% impurities consisted of  multimers and N-terminal cleaved C1INH species. Mass spectrometric analysis of  purified rhC1INH revealed a relative molecular mass (M(r)) of 67,200. Differences  in M(r) on SDS PAGE and mass spectrometric analysis between rhC1INH and pd-hC1INH  are explained by differential glycosylation (calculated carbohydrate contents of  21\% and 28\%, respectively), since protein sequencing analysis of rhC1INH revealed  intact N- and C-termini. Host-related impurity analysis by ELISA revealed trace  amounts of rabbit protein (approximately 10 ppm) in purified batches, but not  endogenous rabbit C1INH. The kinetics of inhibition of the target proteases C1s,  Factor XIIa, kallikrein and Factor XIa by rhC1INH and pd-hC1INH, indicated  comparable inhibitory potency and specificity.

	abstract = {STUDY OBJECTIVES: Patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) exhibit heterogeneous heart rate variability (HRV) during wakefulness and sleep. We  investigated the influence of OSA severity on HRV parameters during wakefulness  in a large international clinical sample. METHODS: 1247 subjects (426 without OSA  and 821 patients with OSA) were enrolled from the Sleep Apnea Global  Interdisciplinary Consortium. HRV parameters were calculated during a 5-minute  wakefulness period with spontaneous breathing prior to the sleep study, using  time-domain, frequency-domain and nonlinear methods. Differences in HRV were  evaluated among groups using analysis of covariance, controlling for relevant  covariates. RESULTS: Patients with OSA showed significantly lower time-domain  variations and less complexity of heartbeats compared to individuals without OSA.  Those with severe OSA had remarkably reduced HRV compared to all other groups.  Compared to non-OSA patients, those with severe OSA had lower HRV based on SDNN  (adjusted mean: 37.4 vs. 46.2 ms; p {\textless} 0.0001), RMSSD (21.5 vs. 27.9 ms; p {\textless}  0.0001), ShanEn (1.83 vs. 2.01; p {\textless} 0.0001), and Forbword (36.7 vs. 33.0; p =  0.0001). While no differences were found in frequency-domain measures overall,  among obese patients there was a shift to sympathetic dominance in severe OSA,  with a higher LF/HF ratio compared to obese non-OSA patients (4.2 vs. 2.7; p =  0.009). CONCLUSIONS: Time-domain and nonlinear HRV measures during wakefulness  are associated with OSA severity, with severe patients having remarkably reduced  and less complex HRV. Frequency-domain measures show a shift to sympathetic  dominance only in obese OSA patients. Thus, HRV during wakefulness could provide  additional information about cardiovascular physiology in OSA patients.

	abstract = {Background Pregnancy-related venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a leading preventable cause of maternal mortality in the United States; however, American  guidelines for pharmacologic VTE prophylaxis remain less aggressive than other  developed countries. The Safe Motherhood Initiative (SMI) combines aspects of  American and international guidelines to increase utilization of prophylaxis and  thereby decrease incidence of pregnancy-related VTE. Objectives To evaluate the  prescribing and administration rates of pharmacologic VTE prophylaxis for women  undergoing cesarean section (c-section) when retrospectively applying the SMI  recommendations. Setting Large academic medical center in Sacramento, California,  USA. Method This was a single-center retrospective cohort study of pregnant women  undergoing c-section who would have met criteria for pharmacologic prophylaxis  according to the SMI. Main outcome measures Prescribing and administration rates  of mechanical and pharmacologic VTE prophylaxis. Secondary outcomes included  incidence of thromboembolism within 6 weeks after c-section and thromboembolic  associated mortality. Results A total of 616 charts were analyzed. When applying  the SMI guidelines for VTE prophylaxis, the prescribing rates for mechanical and  pharmacologic prophylaxis were 94.3\% and 4.71\% of patients, respectively, and  94.9\% of ordered pharmacologic prophylaxis doses were administered. The incidence  of 6-week post-partum VTE was 0.49\%. There were no cases of VTE-associated  mortality. Conclusion This study demonstrated that a large population of  c-section patients fit the SMI criteria for pharmacologic VTE prophylaxis but did  not receive it. We observed a 0.49\% rate of VTE, which was slightly higher than  the nationally reported average rate of 0.3\%. With growing rates of  pregnancy-associated VTE in the United States, perhaps a more aggressive  guideline is warranted.},

	abstract = {CONTEXT: Placental and circulatory soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase 1 (sFlt1) has proven to be elevated in pregnant women with preeclampsia, a disease  characterized by hypertension, proteinuria, and endothelial dysfunction. Recent  studies also demonstrated an autoantibody against the angiotensin II type 1 (AT1)  receptor (AT1-AA) in that disease. OBJECTIVE: Both factors are discussed as key  players in the etiology of preeclampsia. However, it has not yet been clarified  whether these two circulating factors correlate and whether synergy determines  the severity of pathology. DESIGN: AT1-AA was retrospectively determined by a  bioassay and sFlt1 by an ELISA. PATIENTS: Serum from second-trimester pregnancies  with normal or abnormal uterine perfusion and in women at term with or without  pregnancy pathology was analyzed. RESULTS: Most of the preeclamptic patients were  characterized by high sFlt1 levels and the presence of AT1-AA, although the  agonistic effects of the antibody did not correlate with the sFlt1 concentrations  (P = 0.85). Although AT1-AA was also detected in second-trimester pregnancies  evidencing abnormal uterine perfusion without later pathology, sFlt1 was not  significantly elevated in these pregnancies, compared with those with normal  uterine perfusion. However, whereas women with abnormal perfusion and later  pregnancy pathology did not differ in AT1-AA, compared with those with normal  outcome, sFlt1 was significantly increased. Again, the two factors did not  correlate (P = 0.15). CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that AT1-AA bioactivity and sFlt1  concentrations do not correlate, are not mutually dependent, and are thus  probably involved in distinct pathogenetic mechanisms. Both factors in  combination may not be causative for the early impaired trophoblast invasion and  pathological uterine perfusion.},

	abstract = {Sleep disorders are a major risk factor for cardiovascular diseases. Sleep apnea is the most common sleep disturbance and its detection relies on a  polysomnography, i.e., a combination of several medical examinations performed  during a monitored sleep night. In order to detect occurrences of sleep apnea  without the need of combined recordings, we focus our efforts on extracting a  quantifier related to the events of sleep apnea from a cardiovascular time  series, namely systolic blood pressure (SBP). Physiologic time series are  generally highly nonstationary and entrap the application of conventional tools  that require a stationary condition. In our study, data nonstationarities are  uncovered by a segmentation procedure which splits the signal into stationary  patches, providing local quantities such as mean and variance of the SBP signal  in each stationary patch, as well as its duration L. We analysed the data of 26  apneic diagnosed individuals, divided into hypertensive and normotensive groups,  and compared the results with those of a control group. From the segmentation  procedure, we identified that the average duration {\textless}L{\textgreater}, as well as the average  variance {\textless}σ2{\textgreater}, are correlated to the apnea-hypoapnea index (AHI), previously  obtained by polysomnographic exams. Moreover, our results unveil an oscillatory  pattern in apneic subjects, whose amplitude S* is also correlated with AHI. All  these quantities allow to separate apneic individuals, with an accuracy of at  least 79\%. Therefore, they provide alternative criteria to detect sleep apnea  based on a single time series, the systolic blood pressure.},

	abstract = {Obstructive sleep apnea is a highly prevalent sleep-related breathing disorder, resulting in a disturbed breathing pattern, changes in blood gases, abnormal  autonomic regulation, metabolic fluctuation, poor neurocognitive performance, and  increased cardiovascular risk. With broad inter-individual differences recognised  in risk factors, clinical symptoms, gene expression, physiological  characteristics, and health outcomes, various obstructive sleep apnea subtypes  have been identified. Therapeutic efficacy and its impact on outcomes,  particularly for cardiovascular consequences, may also vary depending on these  features in obstructive sleep apnea. A number of interventions such as positive  airway pressure therapies, oral appliance, surgical treatment, and pharmaceutical  options are available in clinical practice. Selecting an effective obstructive  sleep apnea treatment and therapy is a challenging medical decision due to  obstructive sleep apnea heterogeneity and numerous treatment modalities. Thus, an  objective marker for clinical evaluation is warranted to estimate the treatment  response in patients with obstructive sleep apnea. Currently, while the  Apnea-Hypopnea Index is used for severity assessment of obstructive sleep apnea  and still considered a major guide to diagnosis and managements of obstructive  sleep apnea, the Apnea-Hypopnea Index is not a robust marker of symptoms,  function, or outcome improvement. Abnormal cardiac autonomic modulation can  provide additional insight to better understand obstructive sleep apnea  phenotyping. Heart rate variability is a reliable neurocardiac tool to assess  altered autonomic function and can also provide cardiovascular information in  obstructive sleep apnea. Beyond the Apnea-Hypopnea Index, this review aims to  discuss the role of heart rate variability as an indicator and predictor of  therapeutic efficacy to different modalities in order to optimise tailored  treatment for obstructive sleep apnea.},

In polysomnographic datasets of sleep-healthy participants (n = 18) and  patients with insomnia (n = 10), alpha waves were extracted from the relaxed,  wake state before sleep onset, wake after sleep-onset periods and arousals of  sleep. In these, alpha frequency and variability were determined as the median  and standard deviation of inverse peak-to-peak intervals. Before sleep onset,  patients with insomnia showed a decreased alpha variability compared with healthy  participants (P {\textless} 0.05). After sleep onset, both groups showed patterns of  decreased alpha frequency that was lower for wake after sleep-onset periods of  shorter duration. For patients with insomnia, alpha variability increased for  short wake after sleep-onset periods. Major differences between the two groups  were encountered during arousal. In particular, the alpha frequency in patients  with insomnia rebounded to wake levels, while the frequency in healthy  participants remained at the reduced level of short wake after sleep-onset  periods. Reductions in alpha frequency during wake after sleep-onset periods may  be related to the microstate between sleep and wakefulness that was described for  such brief awakenings. Reduced alpha variability before sleep may indicate a  dysfunction of the alpha generation mechanism in insomnia. Alpha characteristics  may also prove valuable in the study of other sleep and attention disorders.},

Five weeks after the start of treatment the blood pressure signals  (500 Hz) were monitored in 10 untreated and 6 age-matched male SHR treated by  AVE0991 for 24 hours (every 2 hours for 10 minutes). The autonomous tone was  estimated from the heart rate and blood pressure variability (HRV, BPV) and from  the spontaneous baroreceptor sensitivity (BRS).AVE0991 treatment blunted the  rodent-characterizing nightly increase in blood pressure and led to pronounced  changes in the BPV and HRV parameters during the night in comparison to untreated  controls (eg, sdNN: AVE0991=8.19 versus control=11.5 mm Hg; P{\textless}0.001). However,  even more significant differences were detected for BRS. Whereas the average  slope did not alter, the activation of the baroreflexes (P{\textless}10E-6) and the number  of baroreflex fluctuations were reduced dramatically by AVE0991 (P{\textless}10E-5).

	abstract = {Pre-eclampsia (PE), a serious pregnancy-specific disorder, causes significant neonatal and maternal morbidity and mortality. Recent studies showed that  cardiovascular variability parameters as well as the baroreflex sensitivity  remarkably improve its early diagnosis. For a better understanding of the  dynamical changes caused by PE, in this study the coupling between respiration,  systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and heart rate is investigated. Thirteen  datasets of healthy pregnant women and 10 of subjects suffering from PE are  included. Nonlinear additive autoregressive models with external input are used  for a model-based coupling analysis following the idea of Granger causality. To  overcome the problem of misdetections of standard methods in systems with a  dominant driver, a heuristic ensemble approach is used here. A coupling is  assumed to be real when existent in more than 80 per cent of the ensemble  members, and otherwise denoted as artefacts. As the main result, we found that  the coupling structure between heart rate, systolic blood pressure, diastolic  blood pressure and respiration for healthy subjects and PE patients is the same  and reliable. As a pathological mechanism, however, a significant increased  respiratory influence on the diastolic blood pressure could be found for PE  patients (p=0.003). Moreover, the nonlinear form of the respiratory influence on  the heart rate is significantly different between the two groups (p=0.002).  Interestingly, the influence of systolic blood pressure on the heart rate is not  selected, which indicates that the baroreflex sensitivity estimation strongly  demands the consideration of causal relationships between heart rate, blood  pressure and respiration. Finally, our results point to a potential role of  respiration for understanding the pathogenesis of PE.},

	abstract = {The investigation of foetal reaction to internal and external conditions and stimuli is an important tool in the characterization of the developing neural  integration of the foetus. An interesting example of this is the study of the  interrelationship between the foetal and the maternal heart rate. Recent studies  have shown a certain likelihood of occasional heart rate synchronization between  mother and foetus. In the case of respiratory-induced heart rate changes, the  comparison with maternal surrogates suggests that the evidence for detected  synchronization is largely statistical and does not result from physiological  interaction. Rather, they simply reflect a stochastic, temporary stability of two  independent oscillators with time-variant frequencies. We reanalysed three  datasets from that study for a more local consideration. Epochs of assumed  synchronization associated with short-term regulation of the foetal heart rate  were selected and compared with synchronization resulting from white noise  instead of the foetal signal. Using data-driven modelling analysis, it was  possible to identify the consistent influence of the heartbeat duration of  maternal beats preceding the foetal beats during epochs of synchronization. These  maternal beats occurred approximately one maternal respiratory cycle prior to the  affected foetal beat. A similar effect could not be found in the epochs without  synchronization. Simulations based on the fitted models led to a higher  likelihood of synchronization in the data segments with assumed foetal-maternal  interaction than in the segment without such assumed interaction. We conclude  that the data-driven model-based analysis can be a useful tool for the  identification of synchronization.},

	abstract = {Objective: The aim of this study was to identify the most sensitive heart rate and blood pressure variability (HRV and BPV) parameters from a given set of  well-known methods for the quantification of cardiovascular autonomic function  after several autonomic blockades. Methods: Cardiovascular sympathetic and  parasympathetic functions were studied in freely moving rats following peripheral  muscarinic (methylatropine), β1-adrenergic (metoprolol), muscarinic +  β1-adrenergic, α1-adrenergic (prazosin), and ganglionic (hexamethonium)  blockades. Time domain, frequency domain and symbolic dynamics measures for each  of HRV and BPV were classified through paired Wilcoxon test for all autonomic  drugs separately. In order to select those variables that have a high relevance  to, and stable influence on our target measurements (HRV, BPV) we used Fisher's  Method to combine the p-value of multiple tests. Results: This analysis led to  the following best set of cardiovascular variability parameters: The mean normal  beat-to-beat-interval/value (HRV/BPV: meanNN), the coefficient of variation (cvNN  = standard deviation over meanNN) and the root mean square differences of  successive (RMSSD) of the time domain analysis. In frequency domain analysis the  very-low-frequency (VLF) component was selected. From symbolic dynamics Shannon  entropy of the word distribution (FWSHANNON) as well as POLVAR3, the non-linear  parameter to detect intermittently decreased variability, showed the best ability  to discriminate between the different autonomic blockades. Conclusion: Throughout  a complex comparative analysis of HRV and BPV measures altered by a set of  autonomic drugs, we identified the most sensitive set of informative  cardiovascular variability indexes able to pick up the modifications imposed by  the autonomic challenges. These indexes may help to increase our understanding of  cardiovascular sympathetic and parasympathetic functions in translational studies  of experimental diseases.},

It is  generally seen as an indicator for a negative prognosis, even if no distinction  in degree is known or understood. This paper aims to improve on existing attempts  by creating a quantification of the behavior of the dynamic desaturation process  of oxygen in the blood. We performed this work on a cohort of 11 subjects with  CHF, reduced left ventricular ejection fraction, and CSR. The dynamic  desaturation process was evaluated according to changes to peripheral capillary  oxygenation SpO2 resulting from highly nonlinear relationships in the ventilatory  system perturbed by periodic breathing. Hypoxaemic burden expressed as a static  index T90 was compared to a novel relative desaturation index RDI , developed in  this paper. While T90 represents a single value calculated using a static cut-off  value of 90\% SpO2 , the RDI is more sensitive to dynamic influences as it uses  the specific maximum change in saturation for each CSR episode. The threshold of  T90 = 22 min per night as suggested by Oldenburg et al. could not be confirmed to  predict survival, but all central apneas resulting in a relative desaturation of  SpO2 above a cut-off value of 8\% were a 100\% positive predictor of mortality. The  RDI proved sufficiently stable in intraindividual measurements across CSR epochs.  Across the cohort, it showed a bimodal distribution for the deceased group,  indicative of a possible aetiological difference. Hence, it is our conclusion  that a dynamic approach to analyse desaturation of oxygen during Cheyne-Stokes  respiration is to be strongly favoured over a static approach to analysis.},

The early detection of AF is paramount  to timely interventions to reduce the morbidity of AF. The DX ICD system combined  with Home Monitoring® allows for continuous atrial rhythm monitoring without the  need for a dedicated atrial lead. OBJECTIVE: To establish the reaction to and  timing of reactions to the detection of atrial high rate episodes (AHRE).  METHODS: A prospective cohort of DX ICD systems was followed up and the response  to AHREs was collected and evaluated. RESULTS: A total of 234 patients were  enrolled; an AHRE ⩾ 6 min was detected in 13.7\% of patients (n= 32) within a mean  follow-up duration of 16 months. A high rate of oral anticoagulation (OAC)  prescription was seen with the detection of AHREs in patients with a not-low risk  CHA2DS2-VASc score. There was a delay in this prescription highlighting the  potential to improve the timeliness of patient care in this group of patients.  CONCLUSIONS: The DX ICD system provides rapid and ongoing atrial rhythm  monitoring such that physicians are rapidly aware of AHRE without the need for a  dedicated atrial lead, but local protocols are needed to improve the response  time of anti-coagulation prescription.},

	abstract = {Many sleep centres try to perform a reduced portable test in order to decrease the number of overnight polysomnographies that are expensive, time-consuming, and  disturbing. With some limitations, heart rate variability (HRV) has been useful  in this task. The aim of this investigation was to evaluate if inclusion of  symbolic dynamics variables to a logistic regression model integrating clinical  and physical variables, can improve the detection of subjects for further  polysomnographies. To our knowledge, this is the first contribution that  innovates in that strategy. A group of 133 patients has been referred to the  sleep center for suspected sleep apnea. Clinical assessment of the patients  consisted of a sleep related questionnaire and a physical examination. The  clinical variables related to apnea and selected in the statistical model were  age (p {\textless} 10(-3)), neck circumference (p {\textless} 10(-3)), score on a questionnaire scale  intended to quantify daytime sleepiness (p {\textless} 10(-3)), and intensity of snoring  (p {\textless} 10(-3)). The validation of this model demonstrated an increase in  classification performance when a variable based on non-linear dynamics of HRV  (p {\textless} 0.01) was used additionally to the other variables. For diagnostic rule  based only on clinical and physical variables, the corresponding area under the  receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was 0.907 (95\% confidence interval  (CI) = 0.848, 0.967), (sensitivity 87.10\% and specificity 80\%). For the model  including the average of a symbolic dynamic variable, the area under the ROC  curve was increased to 0.941 (95\% = 0.897, 0.985), (sensitivity 88.71\% and  specificity 82.86\%). In conclusion, symbolic dynamics, coupled with significant  clinical and physical variables can help to prioritize polysomnographies in  patients with a high probability of apnea. In addition, the processing of the HRV  is a well established low cost and robust technique.},

	abstract = {The knowledge of transitions between regular, laminar or chaotic behaviors is essential to understand the underlying mechanisms behind complex systems. While  several linear approaches are often insufficient to describe such processes,  there are several nonlinear methods that, however, require rather long time  observations. To overcome these difficulties, we propose measures of complexity  based on vertical structures in recurrence plots and apply them to the logistic  map as well as to heart-rate-variability data. For the logistic map these  measures enable us not only to detect transitions between chaotic and periodic  states, but also to identify laminar states, i.e., chaos-chaos transitions. The  traditional recurrence quantification analysis fails to detect the latter  transitions. Applying our measures to the heart-rate-variability data, we are  able to detect and quantify the laminar phases before a life-threatening cardiac  arrhythmia occurs thereby facilitating a prediction of such an event. Our  findings could be of importance for the therapy of malignant cardiac arrhythmias.},

	abstract = {STUDY OBJECTIVES: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is common in commercial motor vehicle operators (CMVOs); however, polysomnography (PSG), the gold-standard  diagnostic test, is expensive and inconvenient for screening. OSA is associated  with changes in heart rate and voltage on electrocardiography (EKG). We evaluated  the utility of EKG parameters in identifying CMVOs at greater risk for  sleepiness-related crashes (apnea-hypopnea index [AHI] ≥ 30 events/h). METHODS:  In this prospective study of CMVOs, we performed EKGs with concurrent PSG, and  calculated the respiratory power index (RPI) on EKG, a surrogate for AHI  calculated from PSG. We evaluated the utility of two-stage predictive models  using simple clinical measures (age, body mass index [BMI], neck circumference,  Epworth Sleepiness Scale score, and the Multi-Variable Apnea Prediction [MVAP]  score) in the first stage, followed by RPI in a subset as the second-stage. We  assessed area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC),  sensitivity, and negative posttest probability (NPTP) for this two-stage approach  and for RPI alone. RESULTS: The best-performing model used the MVAP, which  combines BMI, age, and sex with three OSA symptoms, in the first stage, followed  by RPI in the second. The model yielded an estimated (95\% confidence interval)  AUC of 0.883 (0.767-0.924), sensitivity of 0.917 (0.706-0.962), and NPTP of 0.034  (0.015-0.133). Predictive characteristics were similar using a model with only  BMI as the first-stage screen. CONCLUSIONS: A two-stage model that combines BMI  or the MVAP score in the first stage, with EKG in the second, had robust  discriminatory power to identify severe OSA in CMVOs.},

	abstract = {Fetal heart rate variability (fHRV) is an essential source of information to monitor fetal well-being during pregnancy. This study aimed to apply a nonlinear  approach, known as symbolic dynamics (SD), for comparing human fHRV in the third  trimester of pregnancy during active fetal state (TT) and active labor at term  (P). We performed a longitudinal, prospective, descriptive, and comparative study  composed of 42 longitudinal recordings of 5-minutes of fetal heartbeat interval  series. Recordings were collected from 21 low-risk, healthy, pregnant women  attending the Maternal and Child Research Center (CIMIGen), Mexico City. We  calculated relevant linear parameters of fHRV between TT and P stages, such as  the percentage of differences between adjacent RR intervals {\textgreater}5 ms (PRR5, related  to vagal modulations) and other SD parameters such as the percentage of no  variations between three successive symbols (\%0V, reflects sympathetic  modulations) and the probability of low variability with a threshold of 4 ms  (POLVAR4, associated with a low variability). We identified statistical  differences for PRR5 between TT and P (37.13\% [28.47-47.60\%] vs. 28.84\%  [19.36-36.76\%], p = 0.03), respectively. Also, for 0V\% (65.66\% [59.01-71.80\%] vs.  71.14\% [65.94-75.87\%], p = 0.03) and for POLVAR4 values (0.06 [0.04-0.11] vs.  0.15 [0.09-0.24], p = 0.002), respectively. Our results indicate that during  parturition, the short-term fetal fHRV is decreased, showing a decreased vagal  modulations and higher adrenergic response of the heart. These autonomic  modifications may result from the fetal response to the stressful inflammatory  challenge of labor. We thus confirmed that the analysis of the SD applied to fHRV  time series could be a potential clinical biomarker to differentiate the fetal  autonomic cardiac condition at different stages of pregnancy.},

This work  aimed to identify the best combinations of HRV and heartprint indices for  predicting SCD based on short-term recordings (1000 heartbeats) through a support  vector machine (SVM). Eleven HRV indices and five heartprint indices were  measured in 135 pairs of recordings (one before an SCD episode and another  without SCD as control). SVMs (defined with a radial basis function kernel with  hyperparameter optimization) were trained with this dataset to identify the 13  best combinations of indices systematically. Through 10-fold cross-validation,  the best area under the curve (AUC) value as a function of γ (gamma) and cost was  identified. The predictive value of the identified combinations had AUCs between  0.80 and 0.86 and accuracies between 80 and 86\%. Further SVM performance tests on  a different dataset of 68 recordings (33 before SCD and 35 as control) showed AUC  = 0.68 and accuracy = 67\% for the best combination.

	abstract = {Sleep is a complex regulated process with short periods of wakefulness and different sleep stages. These sleep stages modulate autonomous functions such as  blood pressure and heart rate. The method of symbolic coupling traces (SCT) is  used to analyze and quantify time-delayed coupling of these measurements during  different sleep stages. The symbolic coupling traces, defined as the symmetric  and diametric traces of the bivariate word distribution matrix, allow the  quantification of time-delayed coupling. In this paper, the method is applied to  heart rate and systolic blood pressure time series during different sleep stages  for healthy controls as well as for normotensive and hypertensive patients with  sleep apneas. Using the SCT, significant different cardiovascular mechanisms not  only between the deep sleep and the other sleep stages but also between healthy  subjects and patients can be revealed. The SCT method is applied to model  systems, compared with established methods, such as cross correlation, mutual  information, and cross recurrence analysis and demonstrates its advantages  especially for nonstationary physiological data. As a result, SCT proves to be  more specific in detecting delays of directional interactions than standard  coupling analysis methods and yields additional information which cannot be  measured by standard parameters of heart rate and blood pressure variability. The  proposed method may help to indicate the pathological changes in cardiovascular  regulation and also the effects of continuous positive airway pressure therapy on  the cardiovascular system.},

Therefore, it is challenging to develop sophisticated methods in  order to improve medical diagnostics. The question whether the normal heart rate  is chaotic or not is an attempt to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of  cardiovascular dynamics and therefore a highly controversial topical challenge.  In this contribution we demonstrate that linear and nonlinear parameters allow us  to separate completely the data sets of the three groups provided for this  controversial topic in nonlinear dynamics. The question whether these time series  are chaotic or not cannot be answered satisfactorily without investigating the  underlying mechanisms leading to them. We give an example of the dominant  influence of respiration on heart beat dynamics, which shows that observed  fluctuations can be mostly explained by respiratory modulations of heart rate and  blood pressure (coefficient of determination: 96\%). Therefore, we recommend  reformulating the following initial question: "Is the normal heart rate chaotic?"  We rather ask the following: "Is the normal heart rate 'chaotic' due to  respiration?"},

This study aims to investigate the  diagnostic and prognostic potency of circulating ACE2 activity in patients with  heart failure (HF) from Chagas' disease (CD). METHODS AND RESULTS: Blood samples  were obtained from 111 CD patients and 40 age- and gender-matched healthy  subjects. The CD patients were further subdivided according to their New York  Heart Association classification. ACE2 activity was significantly increased in CD  patients with HF, but not in patients without systolic dysfunction. Moreover,  plasma ACE2 activity was significantly correlated with their clinical severity  and echocardiographic parameters. Importantly, the potency of circulating ACE2  activity in CD patients was equally potent as that of B-type natriuretic peptide  to predict cardiac death and heart transplant. Most importantly, patients with  both parameters elevated were on a 5-fold higher risk to reach an endpoint than  patients with increase in only 1 of the 2 parameters. CONCLUSIONS: Determination  of ACE2 activity may provide a new and important diagnostic and prognostic marker  for patients with CD. ACE2 activity and BNP concentration have additive  predictive value and may be used in combination to offer a new dimension of  prediction in HF.},

Little is known about this relationship although it may offer  potential for the assessment of the fetal condition. Recently we found evidence  of short epochs of fetal-maternal heart rate synchronization under uncontrolled  conditions with spontaneous maternal breathing. Here, we examine whether the  occurrence of such epochs can be influenced by maternal respiratory arrhythmia  induced by paced breathing at several different rates (10, 12, 15, and 20 cycles  per minute). To test for such weak and nonstationary synchronizations among the  fetal-maternal subsystems, we apply a multivariate synchronization analysis  technique and test statistics based on twin surrogates. We find a clear increase  in synchronization epochs mostly at high maternal respiratory rates in the  original but not in the surrogate data. On the other hand, fewer epochs are found  at low respiratory rates both in original and surrogate data. The results suggest  that the fetal cardiac system seems to possess the capability to adjust its rate  of activation in response to external--i.e., maternal--stimulation. Hence, the  pregnant mothers' special awareness to the unborn child may also be reflected by  fetal-maternal interaction of cardiac activity. Our approach opens up the chance  to examine this interaction between independent but closely linked physiological  systems.},

By finding stationary  segments we are able to analyze the size of these segments and evaluate how the  signal changes from one segment to another, looking at the statistical moments  given in each patch, for example, mean and variance. We analyze HRV data for 15  patients with congestive heart failure (CHF; 11 males, 4 females, age 56±11  years), 18 elderly healthy subjects (EH; 11 males, 7 females, age 50±7 years),  and 15 young healthy subjects (YH; 11 females, 4 males, age 31±6 years).

Moreover, it is possible to distinguish between  YH and EH with p {\textless} 0.05 through the segmentation outcomes.

	abstract = {Chagas disease (CD), which is caused by the protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi, is a major cause of heart failure in Latin America. We investigated if plasma activity  of one of the enzymes being part of the renin-angiotensin system, aminopeptidase  A (APA), has diagnostic and prognostic potency in patients with CD and dilated  cardiomyopathies (DCMs) due to other causes. Blood samples were taken from 94  patients with CD, 46 patients with DCM, and 34 healthy control subjects. Plasma  APA activity was determined by fluorometry assays. The average follow-up time was  39 months; by the end of study, 33 patients had died and another 13 received  heart transplant. There was no significant alteration in plasma APA activity in  the patients with CD or DCM, as compared with that in controls. The Pearson  correlation of echocardiographic data with plasma APA activity in patients with  CD and DCM did not reveal any significant correlation with left-ventricular  ejection fraction or other echocardiographic parameters. APA activity was unable  to predict mortality or the need for heart transplant. Detection of APA activity  in plasma may not prove suitable for prognosis in patients with heart failure and  is unable to screen or diagnose asymptomatic patients with CD for early therapy.},

	abstract = {Chagas' disease (CD), caused by the hemoflagellate protozoan, Trypanosoma cruzi, is endemic in most countries of Latin America. Heart failure (HF) is often a late  manifestation of chronic CD, and is associated with high morbidity and mortality.  Inflammatory processes mediated by cytokines play a key role in the pathogenesis  and progression of CD. Keeping in view the inflammatory nature of CD, this study  investigated the possible role of 21 different inflammatory cytokines as  biomarkers for prediction and prognosis of CD. The plasma concentration of these  cytokines was measured in a group of patients with CD (n = 94), and then compared  with those measured in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) from idiopathic  causes (n = 48), and with control subjects (n = 25). Monovariately, plasma levels  of cytokines such as stem cell growth factor beta (SCGF beta), hepatocyte growth  factor (HGF), monokine induced by interferon gamma (CXCL9), and macrophage  inhibitory factor (MIF) were significantly increased in CD patients with advanced  HF compared to control group. None of the cytokines could demonstrate any  prognostic potency in CD patients, and only MIF and stromal derived factor-1  alpha (CXCL12) showed significance in predicting mortality and necessity for  heart transplant in DCM patients. However, multivariate analysis prognosticated a  large proportion of CD and DCM patients. In CD patients, HGF and  Interleukin-12p40 (IL-12p40) together separated 81.9\% of 3-year survivors from  the deceased, while in DCM patients, CXCL12, stem cell factor (SCF), and CXCL9  together discriminated 77.1\% of survivors from the deceased. The significant  increase in plasma concentrations of cytokines such as HGF and CXCL9 in CD  patients, and the ability of these cytokines to prognosticate a large proportion  of CD and DCM patients multivariately, encourages further studies to clarify the  diagnostic and prognostic potential of cytokines in such patients.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Chagas' disease (CD) affects around 18 million people in Latin America. To determine the diagnostic and prognostic value of natriuretic peptides  in patients with CD, we measured atrial (ANP) and brain natriuretic peptide  (BNP), and compared the findings with other dilated cardiomyopathies (DCM).  METHODS: Blood samples were obtained from 111 CD patients, 62 patients with DCM  due to other causes, and 43 gender- and age-matched healthy subjects. The CD and  DCM patients were subdivided according to their NYHA classification. Natriuretic  peptide concentrations were determined by immunoradiometric assays. RESULTS: ANP  and more pronounced BNP levels were increased in CD and DCM patients in relation  to the NYHA class. Circulating BNP concentrations were higher in CD patients in  NYHA classes I-II than in the corresponding DCM patients (p = 0.020).  Importantly, ANP and BNP were already significantly elevated in CD patients  without systolic ventricular dysfunction (p {\textless} or = 0.001). In CD patients, both  peptides were highly correlated with echocardiographic parameters (p {\textless} 10(-14)).  Both ANP and BNP had comparable ability to predict death or the necessity for  heart transplant (p {\textless} 0.0001). CONCLUSION: Natriuretic peptide levels can be used  as a marker of asymptomatic CD without ventricular dysfunction and thus could be  an ideal tool to identify these patients for early therapy.},

CYP enzymes also accept EPA and DHA  to yield more potent vasodilatory and potentially anti-arrhythmic metabolites,  suggesting that the endogenous CYP-eicosanoid profile can be favorably shifted by  dietary omega-3 fatty acids. To test this hypothesis, 20 healthy volunteers were  treated with an EPA/DHA supplement and analyzed for concomitant changes in the  circulatory and urinary levels of AA-, EPA-, and DHA-derived metabolites produced  by the cyclooxygenase-, lipoxygenase (LOX)-, and CYP-dependent pathways. Raising  the Omega-3 Index from about four to eight primarily resulted in a large increase  of EPA-derived CYP-dependent epoxy-metabolites followed by increases of EPA- and  DHA-derived LOX-dependent monohydroxy-metabolites including the precursors of the  resolvin E and D families; resolvins themselves were not detected. The  metabolite/precursor fatty acid ratios indicated that CYP epoxygenases  metabolized EPA with an 8.6-fold higher efficiency and DHA with a 2.2-fold higher  efficiency than AA. Effects on leukotriene, prostaglandin E, prostacyclin, and  thromboxane formation remained rather weak. We propose that CYP-dependent  epoxy-metabolites of EPA and DHA may function as mediators of the vasodilatory  and cardioprotective effects of omega-3 fatty acids and could serve as biomarkers  in clinical studies investigating the cardiovascular effects of EPA/DHA  supplementation.},

The  renin-angiotensin system (RAS) which is a potent regulator of blood pressure,  including its novel beneficial arm with the receptor Mas could be an interesting  target in post-SCI hemodynamics. To test the hypothesis that hemodynamics,  activity and diurnal patterns of those are more affected in the Mas deficient  mice post-SCI we used a mouse model of SCI with complete transection of spinal  cord at thoracic level 4 (T4-Tx) and performed telemetric monitoring of blood  pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR). Our data revealed that hypothermia  deteriorated physiological BP and HR control. Preserving normothermia by keeping  mice at 30°C prevented severe hypotension and bradycardia post-SCI. Moreover, it  facilitated rapid return of diurnal regulation of BP, HR and activity in wild  type (WT) mice. In contrast, although Mas deficient mice had comparable  reacquisition of diurnal HR rhythm, they showed delayed recovery of diurnal  rhythmicity in BP and significantly lower nocturnal activity. Exposing mice with  T4-Tx (kept in temperature-controlled cages) to 23°C room temperature for one  hour at different time-points post-SCI, demonstrated their inability to maintain  core body temperature, Mas deficient mice being significantly more impaired than  WT littermates. We conclude that Mas deficient mice were more resistant to acute  hypotension, delayed nocturnal recovery, lower activity and more severely  impaired thermoregulation. The ambient temperature had significant effect on  hemodynamics and, thus it should be taken into account when assessing  cardiovascular parameters post-SCI in mice.},

	doi = {10.1063/1.2432059},
	abstract = {Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a common primary inherited cardiac muscle disorder, defined clinically by the presence of unexplained left ventricular  hypertrophy. The detection of affected patients remains challenging. Genetic  testing is limited because only in 50\%-60\% of all HCM diagnoses an underlying  mutation can be found. Furthermore, the disease has a varied clinical course and  outcome, with many patients having little or no discernible cardiovascular  symptoms, whereas others develop profound exercise limitation and recurrent  arrhythmias or sudden cardiac death. Therefore prospective screening of HCM  family members is strongly recommended. According to the current guidelines this  includes serial echocardiographic and electrocardiographic examinations. In this  study we investigated the capability of cardiac magnetic field mapping (CMFM) to  detect patients suffering from HCM. We introduce for the first time a combined  diagnostic approach based on map topology quantification using Kullback-Leibler  (KL) entropy and regional magnetic field strength parameters. The cardiac  magnetic field was recorded over the anterior chest wall using a  multichannel-LT-SQUID system. CMFM was calculated based on a regular 36 point  grid. We analyzed CMFM in patients with confirmed diagnosis of HCM (HCM, n=33,  43.8+/-13 years, 13 women, 20 men), a control group of healthy subjects (NORMAL,  n=57, 39.6+/-8.9 years; 22 women and 35 men), and patients with confirmed cardiac  hypertrophy due to arterial hypertension (HYP, n=42, 49.7+/-7.9 years, 15 women  and 27 men). A subgroup analysis was performed between HCM patients suffering  from the obstructive (HOCM, n=19) and nonobstructive (HNCM, n=14) form of the  disease. KL entropy based map topology quantification alone identified HCM  patients with a sensitivity of 78.8\% and specificity of 86.9\% (overall  classification rate 84.8\%). The combination of the KL parameters with a regional  field strength parameter improved the overall classification rate to 87.9\%  (sensitivity: 84.8\%, specificity: 88.9\%, area under ROC curve: 0.94). KL measures  applied to discriminate between HOCM and HNCM patients showed a correct  classification of 78.8\%. The combination of one KL and one regional parameter  again improved the overall classification rate to 97\%. A preliminary prospective  analysis in two HCM families showed the feasibility of this diagnostic approach  with a correct diagnosis of all 22 screened family members (1 HOCM, 4 HNCM, 17  normal). In conclusion, Cardiac Magnetic Field Mapping including KL entropy based  topology quantifications is a suitable tool for HCM screening.},

In this study, concentrations  in trace elements (As, Cd, Hg and Pb), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs),  polychlorodibenzo-para-dioxines (PCDDs) and polychlorodibenzofuranes (PCDFs) were  monitored in 8 fish species sampled on the continental shelf of three French  regions: the Eastern English Channel (EEC) and Bay of Biscay (BoB) in the  Northeast Atlantic Ocean, and the Gulf of Lions (GoL) in Western Mediterranean  Sea. Our objectives were to identify species or regions more likely to be  contaminated and to assess how to take this variability into account in  environmental assessment. While concentrations were higher in benthic and  demersal piscivores, PCB and PCDD/F concentrations (lipid-weight) were similar in  most teleost species. For Cd, Hg and Pb, the trophic group accumulating the  highest concentrations depended on the contaminant and region. Concentrations in  Hg, PCBs and PCDD/Fs were higher in the EEC and/or GoL than in BoB. Cadmium and  Pb concentrations were highest in the BoB. Lipid content accounted for 35\%-84\% of  organic contaminant variability. Lipid normalisation was employed to enhance  robustness in the identification of spatial patterns. Contaminant patterns in  chondrichthyans clearly differed from that in teleosts. In addition, trophic  levels accounted for ≤1\% and ≤33\% of the contaminant variability in teleost  fishes in the EEC and BoB, respectively. Therefore, developing taxa-specific  thresholds might be a more practical way forward for environmental assessment  than normalisation to trophic levels.},

This study  proposes a framework to assess GES in marine waters adjacent to France, including  four groups of species (bivalves, fish, birds and mammals) living on the  continental shelf and covering different dimensions of the marine environment.  This framework is applied to mercury (Hg) in the three marine regions along the  French Atlantic coast and includes two assessment types: i) an absolute  assessment by comparing contamination levels with environmental thresholds, and  ii) a relative assessment by comparing contamination levels over time, performed  for bivalves and mammals that had long time-series available. Mercury  concentrations were higher than environmental thresholds for bivalves and fish in  all the three studied regions. Plus, they significantly increased since the 2000s  for most bivalve stations and for the common dolphin Delphinus delphis. Our  results therefore indicate that Hg concentrations have increased in marine waters  and have reached levels possibly giving rise to pollution effects in biota from  the three marine regions. The present study also highlighted the complementarity  of monitoring Hg concentrations in each group of species and each type of  assessment, making it possible to propose a conceptual framework for assessing  the environmental pressure of bioaccumulated and biomagnified contaminants over  the continental shelf.},

The sleep stages do  modulate the autonomous nervous system and thereby the sleep stages are  accompanied by different regulation regimes for the cardiovascular and  respiratory system. The differences in regulation can be distinguished by new  analysis techniques on the recorded signals. In addition to normal sleep  regulation some sleep disorders affect the cardiovascular and respiratory  regulation. The most prevalent disorder linked to sleep and changes in the  autonomous system is obstructive sleep apnea. In patients with obstructive sleep  apnea marked short term changes in cardiovascular and respiratory regulation are  observed during sleep. These abnormalities in regulation are further  differentiated between the sleep stages. For long term changes obstructive sleep  apnea is recognized as a major risk factor for arterial hypertension. Treatment  of obstructive sleep apnea lowers blood pressure during the night and over time  also lowers blood pressure during daytime. In this study we investigated 18  patients with sleep apnea and normal blood pressure, 10 patients with sleep apnea  and arterial hypertension and 10 normal subjects as controls.

This method uses a normalized Grassberger-Procaccia  algorithm and estimates the dimension in the rather large scales of the system.  This enables us to analyze very short data. First we re-analyze data from the CIC  2002 challenge and can completely distinguish between real data and  computer-generated data using only one parameter. We then analyze unfiltered data  for 15 patients with atrial fibrillation (AF), 15 patients with congestive heart  failure (CHF), 15 elderly healthy subjects, and 18 young healthy subjects. This  method can completely separate the AF group from the other groups and the CHF  patients show significant differences compared to the young and elderly healthy  volunteers. Furthermore, differences are evident in the dimensionality between  day and night for healthy persons, but not for the CHF patients. Finally, the  results are compared to standard heart rate variability parameters.},

	abstract = {The fetal ECG derived from abdominal leads provides an alternative to standard means of fetal monitoring. Furthermore, it permits long-term and ambulant  recordings, which expands the range diagnostic possibilities for evaluating the  fetal health state. However, due to the temporal and spectral overlap of maternal  and fetal signals, the usage of abdominal leads imposes the need for elaborated  signal processing routines.In this work a modular combination of processing  techniques is presented. Its core consists of two maternal ECG estimation  techniques, namely the extended Kalman smoother (EKS) and template adaption (TA)  in combination with an innovative detection algorithm. Our detection method  employs principles of evolutionary computing to detect fetal peaks by considering  the periodicity and morphological characteristics of the fetal signal. In a  postprocessing phase, single channel detections are combined by means of kernel  density estimation and heart rate correction.The described methodology was  presented during the Computing in Cardiology Challenge 2013. The entry was the  winner of the closed-source events with average scores for events 4/5 with  15.1/3.32 (TA) and 69.5/4.58 (EKS) on training set-A and 20.4/4.57 (TA) and  219/7.69 (EKS) on test set-B, respectively. Using our own clinical data (24  subjects each 20 min recordings) and statistical measures beyond the Challenge's  scoring system, we further validated the proposed method. For our clinical data  we obtained an average detection rate of 82.8\% (TA) and 83.4\% (EKS). The achieved  results show that the proposed methods are able produce reliable fetal heart rate  estimates from a restricted number of abdominal leads.},

Their ability to detect systematic changes caused  by different states, diseases and treatments shall be shown for sleep disorders.  Therefore, we consider 18 normotensive and 10 hypertensive patients suffering  from obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) before and after a three-month  continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy. Additionally, an age and sex  matched control group of 10 healthy subjects is examined. Linear and nonlinear  parameters of heart rate and blood pressure fluctuation as well as the baroreflex  sensitivity are used to answer the question whether there are differences in  cardiovascular regulation between the different sleep stages and groups.  Moreover, the therapeutic effect of CPAP therapy in OSAS patients shall be  investigated. Kruskal-Wallis tests between the sleep stages for each group show  significant differences in the very low spectral component of heart rate (VLF/P:  0.0033-0.04 Hz, p{\textless}0.01) which indicates differences in metabolic activity during  the night. Furthermore, the decrease of Shannon entropy of word distribution as a  parameter of systolic blood pressure during non-REM sleep reflects the local  dominance of the vagal system (p{\textless}0.05). The increased sympathetic activation of  the patients leads to clear differences of cardiovascular regulation in different  sleep stages between controls and patients. We found a significant reduction of  baroreflex sensitivity in slow wave sleep in the OSAS patients (Mann-Whitney  test, p{\textless}0.05) compared to controls, which disappeared after three months of CPAP  therapy. Hence, our results demonstrate the ability of cardiovascular analyzes to  separate between healthy and pathological regulation as well as between different  severities of OSAS in this retrospective study.},

	abstract = {Standard time and frequency parameters of heart rate variability (HRV) describe only linear and periodic behaviour, whereas more complex relationships cannot be  recognised. A method that may be capable of assessing more complex properties is  the non-linear measure of 'renormalised entropy.' A new concept of the method,  RE(AR), has been developed, based on a non-linear renormalisation of  autoregressive spectral distributions. To test the hypothesis that renormalised  entropy may improve the result of high-risk stratification after myocardial  infarction, it is applied to a clinical pilot study (41 subjects) and to  prospective data of the St George's Hospital post-infarction database (572  patients). The study shows that the new RE(AR) method is more reproducible and  more stable in time than a previously introduced method (p{\textless}0.001). Moreover, the  results of the study confirm the hypothesis that on average, the survivors have  negative values of RE(AR) (-0.11+/-0.18), whereas the non-survivors have positive  values (0.03+/-0.22, p{\textless}0.01). Further, the study shows that the combination of an  HRV triangular index and RE(AR) leads to a better prediction of sudden arrhythmic  death than standard measurements of HRV. In summary, the new RE(AR) method is an  independent measure in HRV analysis that may be suitable for risk stratification  in patients after myocardial infarction.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Impairment of the baroreceptor reflex activity reflects an alteration of the autonomous regulation of the cardiovascular system and has proven to  predict fatal outcome in patients after acute myocardial infarction. The  following study was performed to analyse the baroreceptor sensitivity, heart rate  variability and blood pressure variability in patients early after coronary  surgery. METHODS: Twenty-five male patients undergoing coronary artery bypass  were examined in a prospective study; normal values were obtained from healthy  volunteers. Arterial pressure signals were recorded from a radial artery catheter  for 30 min preoperatively and in short intervals after surgery. Mechanical  manipulations and pharmacological interventions were avoided during the sampling  periods. Baroreflex function was calculated according to the dual sequence  method, heart rate variability and blood pressure variability were calculated  including nonlinear methods. RESULTS: Initial values of the patients did not  differ from healthy volunteers. The strength of baroreflex sensitivity (increase  in blood pressure causing a synchronous decrease of heart rate) is low 2 h  postoperatively. The number of delayed tachycardic changes of heart rate, which  are caused by sympathetic activation, is only moderately reduced as compared to  values obtained from healthy volunteers. Heart rate variability is widely  unchanged as compared to preoperative values; blood pressure variability showed  an increase of low-frequency components, again indicating sympathetic  predominance. Nonlinear analyses revealed reduced system complexity at the  beginning of the postoperative course. CONCLUSION: Obviously, there is a vagal  suppression 20 h after surgery, while the sympathetic tonus works in a normal  range. This unbalanced interaction of the autonomous systems is similar to  findings in patients after myocardial infarction. The predictive value of these  markers has to be elucidated in further clinical studies.},

We analysed the utility of CMFM for the detection of  patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) without subjecting them to stress. We  studied 59 healthy control subjects and 101 patients with CAD without previous  myocardial infarction (MI). The heart's magnetic field was recorded over the  anterior chest wall using a multichannel magnetic measurement system with axial  second-order gradiometers. The evaluation of CMFM was based on comparison of the  'ideal' group mean maps of young healthy subjects and maps of examined  individuals. Three measures of similarity were considered: Kullback-Leibler (KL)  entropy, normalized residual magnetic field strength and deviations in the  magnetic field map orientation. The mean values of these parameters during the  depolarization and repolarization were used for further classification with the  help of logistic regression. The feature set based on the KL-entropy demonstrated  the best classification results (sensitivity/specificity of 85/80\%), followed by  the residual feature (85/75\%) and the magnetic field orientation feature (80/73\%)  sets. The forward stepwise technique was applied to select the best set of  features from the combined feature set. Two parameters were selected, namely the  KL-entropy for the repolarization period and the residual parameter for the  depolarization period. The classification based on these parameters demonstrated  a sensitivity of 88\% and a specificity of 88\% for the distinction of CAD patients  from the control subjects. The area under the receiver operator curve was 94\%.  Hence, we suggest that CMFM evaluation based on KL-entropy is a promising  technique to identify patients with CAD.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Atrial fibrillation (AF) occurs in 20-40\% of patients after open heart surgery and leads to an increased morbidity and prolonged hospital stay.  Earlier studies have demonstrated that depressed baroreflex function predicts  mortality and major arrhythmic events in patients surviving myocardial  infarction. Cardiac surgery per se leads to decreased baroreflex sensitivity  (BRS) and heart rate variability (HRV). Hence, the present study was aimed at  analyzing the impact of the cardiovascular autonomous system on the development  of postsurgical AF. METHODS AND RESULTS: The study covered 51 patients who  consecutively underwent aortic valve replacement, coronary artery bypass surgery,  or combined procedures. Noninvasive blood pressure and ECG were recorded the day  before and 24 hour after surgery. BRS, linear as well as nonlinear HRV parameters  were calculated using established methods. Eighteen patients developed AF during  the first postoperative week, while 33 remained in sinus rhythm (SR) throughout  the observation period. Patients with postoperative (PostOp) AF exhibited a  significantly reduced preoperative (PreOp) BRS in terms of bradycardic and  tachycardic regulation (average delayed slope [ms/mmHg]: SR: PreOp: 9.83 +/-  3.26, PostOp: 6.02 +/- 2.29, Pre-Post: P {\textless} 0.001; AF: PreOp: 7.59 +/- 1.99,  PostOp: 6.39 +/- 3.67, Pre-Post: P {\textless} 0.044; AF vs SR: PreOp: P {\textless} 0.01, PostOp:  ns). In both groups, surgery caused a decrease of BRS and HRV. Analysis of  nonlinear dynamics revealed a tendency toward decreased system complexity caused  by the operation; this trend was significant in patients remaining in sinus  rhythm. CONCLUSIONS: Patients experiencing postoperative AF obviously suffer from  an impaired BRS before surgery already. These findings may be used to guide  prophylactic antiarrhythmic therapy.},

	abstract = {The analysis of symbolic dynamics applied to physiological time series is able to retrieve information about dynamical properties of the underlying system that  cannot be gained with standard methods like e.g. spectral analysis. Different  approaches for the transformation of the original time series to the symbolic  time series have been proposed. Yet the differences between the approaches are  unknown. In this study three different transformation methods are investigated:  (1) symbolization according to the deviation from the average time series, (2)  symbolization according to several equidistant levels between the minimum and  maximum of the time series, (3) binary symbolization of the first derivative of  the time series. Each method was applied to the cardiac interbeat interval series  RR(i) and its difference ΔRR(I) of 17 healthy subjects obtained during head-up  tilt testing. The symbolic dynamics of each method is analyzed by means of the  occurrence of short sequences ('words') of length 3. The occurrence of words is  grouped according to words without variations of the symbols (0V\%), words with  one variation (1V\%), two like variations (2LV\%) and two unlike variations (2UV\%).  Linear regression analysis showed that for method 1 0V\%, 1V\%, 2LV\% and 2UV\%  changed with increasing tilt angle. For method 2 0V\%, 2LV\% and 2UV\% changed with  increasing tilt angle and method 3 showed changes for 0V\% and 1V\%. In conclusion,  all methods are capable of reflecting changes of the cardiac autonomic nervous  system during head-up tilt. All methods show that even the analysis of very short  symbolic sequences is capable of tracking changes of the cardiac autonomic  regulation during head-up tilt testing.},

This study evaluated the ability for PTT via PES/PCS to  correlate with systolic, diastolic, and mean invasive blood pressure (SBP(IBP),  DBP(IBP), and MAP(IBP), respectively) and to detect SBP(IBP) fluctuations.  METHODS: PES/PCS and IBP measurements were performed in 20 patients undergoing  abdominal, urological, and cardiac surgery. A Pearson's correlation analysis (r)  between 1/PTT and IBP was performed. The predictive ability of 1/PTT with changes  in SBP(IBP) was determined by area under the curve (reported as AUC, sensitivity,  specificity). RESULTS: Significant correlations between 1/PTT and SBP(IBP) were  found for PES (r = 0.64) and PCS (r = 0.55) (p {\textless} 0.01), as well as  MAP(IBP)/DBP(IBP) for PES (r = 0.6/0.55) and PCS (r = 0.5/0.45) (p {\textless} 0.05). A 7\%  decrease in 1/PTT(PES) predicted a 30\% SBP(IBP) decrease (0.82, 0.76, 0.76),  while a 5.6\% increase predicted a 30\% SBP(IBP) increase (0.75, 0.7, 0.68). A 6.6\%  decrease in 1/PTT(PCS) detected a 30\% SBP(IBP) decrease (0.81, 0.72, 0.8), while  a 4.8\% 1/PTT(PCS) increase detected a 30\% SBP(IBP) increase (0.73, 0.64, 0.68).  CONCLUSIONS: Non-invasive beat-to-beat PTT via PES/PCS demonstrated significant  correlations with IBP and detected significant changes in SBP(IBP).

	abstract = {Heart rate variability is a relevant predictor of cardiovascular risk in humans. However, to use heart and blood pressure (BP) variability or baroreflex  sensitivity as markers for hypertensive pregnancy disorders, it is first  necessary to describe these parameters in normal pregnancy. To accommodate the  complexities of autonomic cardiovascular control we added parameter domains of  nonlinear dynamics to conventional linear methods of time and frequency domains.  The BP of 27 women with normal pregnancy and 14 nonpregnant women were monitored  at a high resolution (200 Hz sampling frequency) using a Portapres for 30 min.  The pregnant women were divided into groups of 32 or less or greater than 32  weeks of gestation. Pregnant and nonpregnant women were classified into  subclasses of maternal age of less than 28 or 28 or more years. Except for two  single parameter domains, we found no significant differences in heart rate and  BP variability for pregnant women with different gestational age or different  maternal age. Moreover, no significant differences in spontaneous baroreflex  sensitivity could be found between pregnant women regardless of either their age  or gestational age. In contrast, all measures of nonlinear dynamics of heart rate  variability as well as all parameter domains of spontaneous baroreflex  sensitivity showed significant changes between pregnant and nonpregnant women,  whereas BP variability did not differ between those groups. This complex  assessment of autonomic cardiovascular regulation has shown that the parameters  tested are stable in the second half of normal pregnancy, and might have the  potential to be excellent indicators of pathophysiologic conditions.},

This was a cross-sectional observational study on 47 patients (age  36 ± 9.2 standard deviation) diagnosed with mild (23.4\%), moderate (34\%), or  severe (42.6\%) OSA. HRV was studied by linear measures of fast Fourier transform,  nonlinear Poincaré analysis, and detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA)—DFA α1  characterizes short-term fluctuations, DFA α2 characterizes long-term  fluctuations. Associations between polysomnography indexes (AHI, arousal index  [AI], and oxygen desaturation index [ODI]) and HRV indexes were studied. Patients  with different grades of AHI had similar sympathovagal balance levels as  indicated by the frequency-domain and Poincaré HRV indexes. The DFA α2 index was  significantly positive correlated with AHI, AI, and ODI (Pearson r: 0.55, 0.59,  and 0.59, respectively, with P {\textless} 0.0001). The ROC analysis revealed that DFA α2  index predicted moderate and severe OSA with a sensitivity/specificity/area under  the curve of 0.86/0.64/0.8 (P = 0.005) and 0.6/0.89/0.76 (P = 0.003),  respectively.

It is also a strong predictor of mortality in some heart failure (HF)  patients. However, its prognostic value in patients with Chagas' disease (CD) or  idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) remains to be investigated. METHODS AND  RESULTS: In this prospective cohort study, HGF concentrations were measured in  patients with CD (n = 91), DCM (n = 47), and control subjects (n = 25). While no  difference was detected for patients with New York Heart Association class I-II,  HGF was significantly increased in advanced HF patients (New York Heart  Association class III-IV) in both CD and DCM groups, compared with healthy  subjects. There was a strong correlation between HGF and left ventricular  ejection fraction in CD patients. However, there was no correlation in patients  with DCM. Despite its strong correlation with left ventricular ejection fraction  in CD patients, HGF failed to predict mortality and necessity for heart  transplant in both CD and DCM patients. CONCLUSIONS: Although HGF can be  significantly increased in advanced HF patients with CD and DCM, its prognostic  value for endpoints is minor. Therefore, the formerly described predictive power  for HGF in HF might be restricted to specific etiologies of HF.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: In spite of intensive efforts, understanding of the genetic aspects of familial prostate cancer (PC) remains largely incomplete. In a previous  microsatellite-based linkage scan of 1,233 PC families, we identified suggestive  evidence for linkage (i.e., LOD ≥ 1.86) at 5q12, 15q11, 17q21, 22q12, and two  loci on 8p, with additional regions implicated in subsets of families defined by  age at diagnosis, disease aggressiveness, or number of affected members. METHODS:  In an attempt to replicate these findings and increase linkage resolution, we  used the Illumina 6000 SNP linkage panel to perform a genome-wide linkage scan of  an independent set of 762 multiplex PC families, collected by 11 International  Consortium for Prostate Cancer Genetics (ICPCG) groups. RESULTS: Of the regions  identified previously, modest evidence of replication was observed only on the  short arm of chromosome 8, where HLOD scores of 1.63 and 3.60 were observed in  the complete set of families and families with young average age at diagnosis,  respectively. The most significant linkage signals found in the complete set of  families were observed across a broad, 37 cM interval on 4q13-25, with LOD scores  ranging from 2.02 to 2.62, increasing to 4.50 in families with older average age  at diagnosis. In families with multiple cases presenting with more aggressive  disease, LOD scores over 3.0 were observed at 8q24 in the vicinity of previously  identified common PC risk variants, as well as MYC, an important gene in PC  biology. CONCLUSIONS: These results will be useful in prioritizing future  susceptibility gene discovery efforts in this common cancer.},

	abstract = {In the US, it is currently estimated that 3\% of pregnant women have chronic hypertension, or more than 100,000 pregnant women each year. The aim of our study  was to investigate the adaptation of autonomic control during pregnancy based on  heart rate variability analysis and to determine whether chronic hypertension  during pregnancy has an impact on this adaptation. Sixteen pregnant women with  chronic hypertension (CH group; mean age, 30 years; range, 25-33 years) and 35  healthy pregnant women serving as controls (CON group; mean age, 28 years; range,  24-30 years) were recruited for this longitudinal study. Beginning at the 20th  week of pregnancy, the women were monitored every 4th week until delivery. For  the analysis of heart rate variability, Portapres signals (200 Hz) were recorded  for 30 min under resting conditions. Women in the CH group had significantly  elevated blood pressure compared to controls (CON, 111 mmHg [105-132]; CH, 140  mmHg [132-148]; p{\textless}0.001). An increased heart rate was found in both groups during  the second half of pregnancy. Consequently, decreased heart rate variability was  observed, but was more pronounced in the CON group. There was a shift in the  frequency bands indicated by an elevation of the low-to-high frequency ratio  (LF/HF) in both groups due to a decrease in HF, and thus a significant increase  in LFn (LF power in normalized units). However, VLF (power of very low frequency  range) increased exclusively in the CON pregnancies. Our data showed no  significant difference in heart rate variability between the subjects of the CH  and CON groups. Longitudinal variations were detectable in normal pregnancies and  also, albeit to a lesser degree, in chronic hypertensive pregnant women. Thus,  our data indicate that patients with long-term hypertension are still able to  respond to the physiological changes occurring during pregnancy.},

METHODS AND  RESULTS: We studied the ICD stored 1000 beat-to-beat intervals before the onset  of VT (131 episodes) and during a control time without VT (74 series) in 63  chronic heart failure ICD patients. Standard HRV parameters as well as two  nonlinear parameters, namely 'Polvar10' from symbolic dynamics and the finite  time growth rates 'Fitgra9' were calculated. Comparing the control and the VT  series, no linear HRV parameter showed a significant difference. The nonlinear  parameters detected a significant increase in short phases with low variability  before the onset of VT (for time series with less than 10\% ectopy, P{\textless}0.05).  Subdividing VT into fast (cycle length {\textless}or=270 ms) and slow ({\textgreater}270 ms) events, we  found that the onset of slow VT was characterized by a significant increase in  heart rate, whereas fast VT was triggered during decreased heart rates, compared  to the control series. CONCLUSIONS: Our data may permit the development of  automatic ICD algorithms based on nonlinear dynamic HRV parameters to predict VT  before it starts. Furthermore, they may facilitate improved prevention  strategies.},

The transgenic proteins were stably integrated into the  sarcomere, as shown by immunohistochemistry using a human-specific  anti-alpha-tropomyosin antibody, ARG1. In transgenic rats with either  alpha-tropomyosin mutation, molecular markers of cardiac hypertrophy were  induced. Ca(2+) sensitivity of cardiac skinned-fiber preparations from animals  with mutation Asp(175)Asn, but not Glu(180)Gly, was decreased. Furthermore,  elevated frequency and amplitude of spontaneous Ca(2+) waves were detected only  in cardiomyocytes from animals with mutation Asp(175)Asn, suggesting an increase  in intracellular Ca(2+) concentration compensating for the reduced Ca(2+)  sensitivity of isometric force generation. Accordingly, in Langendorff-perfused  heart preparations, myocardial contraction and relaxation were accelerated in  animals with mutation Asp(175)Asn. The results allow us to propose a hypothesis  of the pathogenetic changes caused by alpha-tropomyosin mutation Asp(175)Asn in  familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy on the basis of changes in Ca(2+) handling  as a sensitive mechanism to compensate for alterations in sarcomeric structure.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Scoring sleep visually based on polysomnography is an important but time-consuming element of sleep medicine. Whereas computer software assists human  experts in the assignment of sleep stages to polysomnogram epochs, their  performance is usually insufficient. This study evaluates the possibility to  fully automatize sleep staging considering the reliability of the sleep stages  available from human expert sleep scorers. METHODS: We obtain features from EEG,  ECG and respiratory signals of polysomnograms from ten healthy subjects. Using  the sleep stages provided by three human experts, we evaluate the performance of  linear discriminant analysis on the entire polysomnogram and only on epochs where  the three experts agree in their sleep stage scoring. RESULTS: We show that in  polysomnogram intervals, to which all three scorers assign the same sleep stage,  our algorithm achieves 90\% accuracy. This high rate of agreement with the human  experts is accomplished with only a small set of three frequency features from  the EEG. We increase the performance to 93\% by including ECG and respiration  features. In contrast, on intervals of ambiguous sleep stage, the sleep stage  classification obtained from our algorithm, agrees with the human consensus  scorer in approximately 61\%. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that machine  classification is highly consistent with human sleep staging and that error in  the algorithm's assignments is rather a problem of lack of well-defined criteria  for human experts to judge certain polysomnogram epochs than an insufficiency of  computational procedures.},

Heart rate variability (HRV) and blood  pressure variability (BPV) were analyzed using time- and frequency domain, as  well as non-linear measures. The dual sequence method was used for the estimation  of the baroreflex regulation. In transgenic rats harboring mutated TPM1, changes  in HRV were detected during exercise, but not at rest. Both mutations, Asp175Asn  and Glu180Gly, caused increased low frequency power. In addition, in animals with  mutation Asp175Asn a reduced total HRV was observed. BPV did not show any  differences between all transgenic animal lines. During exercise, a strong  increase in the number of bradycardic and tachycardic fluctuations accompanied  with decreased baroreflex sensitivity (BRS) was detected in animals with either  TPM1 mutation, Asp175Asn or Glu180Gly.

Therefore, we introduce linear and nonlinear variables, namely Cepstrum  Coefficients (CC), Filterbanks (Fbank) and Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (DFA).  Logistic Regression, Linear Discriminant Analysis and Quadratic Discriminant  Analysis were used for classification purposes. The experiments were carried out  using two databases. We achieved a per-segment accuracy of 84.76\%  (sensitivity = 81.45\%, specificity = 86.82\%, AUC = 0.92) in the Apnea-ECG  Physionet database, whereas in the HuGCDN2014 database, provided by the Dr.  Negrín University Hospital (Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, Spain), the best results  were: accuracy = 81.96\%, sensitivity = 70.95\%, specificity = 85.47\%, AUC = 0.87.  The former results were comparable or better than those obtained by other methods  for the same database in the recent literature. We have concluded that the  selected features that best characterize the underlying process are common to  both databases. This supports the fact that the conclusions reached are  potentially generalizable. The best results were obtained when the three kinds of  features were jointly used. Another notable fact is the small number of features  needed to describe the phenomenon. Results suggest that the two first Fbanks, the  first CC and the first DFA coefficient are the variables that best describe the  RR pattern in OSA and, therefore, are especially relevant to extract  discriminative information for apnea screening purposes.},

Sixty-eight  beat-to-beat time series from 13 patients with an ICD were analyzed to quantify  heart rate variability and ventricular arrhythmias. The episodes of VT were  classified in one of two groups depending on whether the sinus rate in the 1 min  preceding the VT was greater or less than 90 beats per minute. In a subset of  patients, increased heart rate and reduced heart rate variability was often  observed up to 20 min prior to the VT. There was a non-significant trend to  higher incidence of premature ventricular complexes (PVCs) before VT compared to  control recordings. The patterns of the ventricular arrhythmias were highly  heterogeneous among different patients and even within the same patient. Analysis  of the changes of heart rate and heart rate variability may have predictive value  about the onset of VT in selected patients.

Model-based analysis of these variabilities additionally leads to new prognostic  information about mechanisms behind regulations in the cardiovascular system. In  this paper, we analyze the complex interaction between heart rate, systolic blood  pressure, and respiration by nonparametric fitted nonlinear additive  autoregressive models with external inputs. Therefore, we consider measurements  of healthy persons and patients suffering from obstructive sleep apnea syndrome  (OSAS), with and without hypertension. It is shown that the proposed nonlinear  models are capable of describing short-term fluctuations in heart rate as well as  systolic blood pressure significantly better than similar linear ones, which  confirms the assumption of nonlinear controlled heart rate and blood pressure.  Furthermore, the comparison of the nonlinear and linear approaches reveals that  the heart rate and blood pressure variability in healthy subjects is caused by a  higher level of noise as well as nonlinearity than in patients suffering from  OSAS. The residue analysis points at a further source of heart rate and blood  pressure variability in healthy subjects, in addition to heart rate, systolic  blood pressure, and respiration. Comparison of the nonlinear models within and  among the different groups of subjects suggests the ability to discriminate the  cohorts that could lead to a stratification of hypertension risk in OSAS  patients.},

The aim  of this study was to investigate the differences in HRV estimated from continuous  blood pressure (BP) measurement by different methods in comparison to  electrocardiogram (ECG) signals. The beat-to-beat intervals (BBI) were  simultaneously extracted from the ECG and blood pressure of 9 cardiac patients  (10 min, Colin system, 1000-Hz sampling frequency). For both data types, slope,  peak, and correlation detection algorithms were applied. The short-term  variability was calculated using concurrent 10-min BP and ECG segments. The root  mean square errors in comparison to ECG slope detection were: 1.74 ms for ECG  correlation detection; 5.42 ms for ECG peak detection; 5.45 ms for BP slope  detection; 5.75 ms for BP correlation detection; and 11.96 ms for BP peak  detection. Our results show that the variability obtained with ECG is the most  reliable. Moreover, slope detection is superior to peak detection and slightly  superior to correlation detection. In particular, for ECG signals with higher  frequency characteristics, peak detection often exhibits more artificial  variability. Besides measurement noise, respiratory modulation and pulse transit  time play an important role in determining BBI. The slope detection method  applied to ECG should be preferred, because it is more robust as regards  morphological changes in the signals, as well as physiological properties. As the  ECG is not recorded in most animal studies, distal pulse wave measurement in  combination with correlation or slope detection may be considered an acceptable  alternative.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Genetic variants are likely to contribute to a portion of prostate cancer risk. Full elucidation of the genetic etiology of prostate cancer is  difficult because of incomplete penetrance and genetic and phenotypic  heterogeneity. Current evidence suggests that genetic linkage to prostate cancer  has been found on several chromosomes including the X; however, identification of  causative genes has been elusive. METHODS: Parametric and non-parametric linkage  analyses were performed using 26 microsatellite markers in each of 11 groups of  multiple-case prostate cancer families from the International Consortium for  Prostate Cancer Genetics (ICPCG). Meta-analyses of the resultant family-specific  linkage statistics across the entire 1,323 families and in several predefined  subsets were then performed. RESULTS: Meta-analyses of linkage statistics  resulted in a maximum parametric heterogeneity lod score (HLOD) of 1.28, and an  allele-sharing lod score (LOD) of 2.0 in favor of linkage to Xq27-q28 at 138 cM.  In subset analyses, families with average age at onset less than 65 years  exhibited a maximum HLOD of 1.8 (at 138 cM) versus a maximum regional HLOD of  only 0.32 in families with average age at onset of 65 years or older.  Surprisingly, the subset of families with only 2-3 affected men and some evidence  of male-to-male transmission of prostate cancer gave the strongest evidence of  linkage to the region (HLOD = 3.24, 134 cM). For this subset, the HLOD was  slightly increased (HLOD = 3.47 at 134 cM) when families used in the original  published report of linkage to Xq27-28 were excluded. CONCLUSIONS: Although there  was not strong support for linkage to the Xq27-28 region in the complete set of  families, the subset of families with earlier age at onset exhibited more  evidence of linkage than families with later onset of disease. A subset of  families with 2-3 affected individuals and with some evidence of male to male  disease transmission showed stronger linkage signals. Our results suggest that  the genetic basis for prostate cancer in our families is much more complex than a  single susceptibility locus on the X chromosome, and that future explorations of  the Xq27-28 region should focus on the subset of families identified here with  the strongest evidence of linkage to this region.},

Heart rate variability (HRV), blood pressure variability  (BPV), and baroreflex sensitivity (BRS) are relevant predictors of cardiovascular  risk in humans.

Continuous heart rate  and blood pressure recordings were performed in 80 healthy pregnant women as  controls (CON), 19 with chronic hypertension (CH), 18 with pregnancy-induced  hypertension (PIH), and 44 with pre-eclampsia (PE). The data were assessed by  time and frequency domain analysis, nonlinear dynamics, and BRS. BPV is markedly  altered in all three groups with hypertensive disorders compared to healthy  pregnancies, whereby changes were most pronounced in PE patients. Interestingly,  this increase in PE patients did not lead to elevated spontaneous baroreflex  events, while BPV changes in both the other hypertensive groups were paralleled  by alterations in baroreflex parameters. The HRV is unaltered in CH and PE but  significantly impaired in PIH. We conclude that parameters of the HRV, BPV, and  BRS differ between various hypertensive pregnancy disorders.

On the  basis of several HRV parameters, an optimal discrimination between the different  kinds of cardiovascular diseases and between the diseases and healthy controls  (HC) was derived by feature selection and linear classification. For each task a  small favourable subset of a set of 33 potentially interesting HRV measures was  selected with the intention of improving the diagnostic value and facilitating  the physiological interpretation of HRV analysis. Time- and frequency-domain  parameters as well as parameters from non-linear dynamics were included in the  analysis. With the expectation that different diseases are characterized by  different phenomena, feature selection was applied for each task separately.  Using the features optimal for one task to another task can reveal a loss in  performance, but it turned out that one specific parameter set (set1: normalized  low frequency LF/P and a non-linear variability measure WPSUM13) was applicable  for all tasks, where diseased and healthy subjects have to be distinguished,  without significant reduction in performance. This set seems to be a general  marker for pathologic changes in HRV and might be used for early detection of  heart diseases. The classification between different heart diseases requires  another parameter set (set2: meanNN and sdaNN, reflecting the steady state  behaviour of the heart rate and long and short term SEAR describing the spectral  composition). However, the use of set1 for the separation of different kinds of  diseases, where set2 is appropriate, led to significant reduction in performance  and vice versa. This observation may be important for future developments of HRV  measures especially suitable for the assessment of disease severity.},

The objective of this study is  to find early signs of sustained VT-VF in patients with an implanted  cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD). These devices are able to safeguard patients by  returning their hearts to a normal rhythm via strong defibrillatory shocks;  additionally, they store the 1000 beat-to-beat intervals immediately before the  onset of a life-threatening arrhythmia. We study these 1000 beat-to-beat  intervals of 17 chronic heart failure ICD patients before the onset of a  life-threatening arrhythmia and at a control time, i.e., without a VT-VF event.  To characterize these rather short data sets, we calculate heart rate variability  parameters from the time and frequency domain, from symbolic dynamics as well as  the finite-time growth rates. We find that neither the time nor the frequency  domain parameters show significant differences between the VT-VF and the control  time series. However, two parameters from symbolic dynamics as well as the  finite-time growth rates discriminate significantly both groups. These findings  could be of importance in algorithms for next generation ICD's to improve the  diagnostics and therapy of VT-VF.},

A study of  the influence of the time delay (lag) in the calculation of CD was performed.  Good discrimination between both groups (p{\textless}0.005) was obtained with lag values of  5 or greater. CD values of DCM patients (8.4+/-1.9) were significantly lower than  CD values for controls (9.5+/-1.9). An analysis of CD values of HRV showed that  for healthy people, CD night values (10.6+/-1.8) were significant greater than CD  day values (9.2+/-1.9), revealing a circadian rhythm.

The following study was performed to assess the differences in the  post-operative recovery of autonomic regulation after mitral valve (MV) and  aortic valve (AV) surgery with a heart-lung machine. Among the 43 consecutive  male patients enrolled in a prospective study, 26 underwent isolated AV surgery  and 17 isolated MV surgery. Blood pressure as well as ECG signals were recorded  the day before, 24 hours after and one week after surgery. BRS was calculated  according to the dual sequence method, and HRV was calculated using standard  linear as well as nonlinear parameters. There were no major differences between  the two groups in the pre-operative values. At 24 hours a comparable depression  of HRV and BRS in both groups was observed, while at 7 days there was partial  recovery in AV patients, which was absent in MV patients: p(AV versus MV){\textless}0.001.  While the response of the autonomic system to surgery is similar in AV and MV  patients, there is obviously a decreased ability to recover in MV patients,  probably attributed to traumatic lesions of the autonomic nervous system by  opening the atria. Ongoing research is required for further clarification of the  pathophysiology of this phenomenon and to establish strategies to restore  autonomic function.},

The aim of  this study was to determine the heritability of HRV and related parameters in  monozygotic and dizygotic twins and to assess the influence of ACE and  angiotensinogen polymorphisms. We studied 95 MZ pairs and 46 DZ pairs. We  measured HRV and related parameters, ACE and angiotensinogen levels, plasma  norepinephrine, ACE, and angiotensinogen genotypes. We found that HRV and related  parameters were significantly influenced by genetic variability, although  nonshared genetic effects were also important. Angiotensinogen and plasma  norepinephrine were generally correlated with decreased HRV, whereas ACE was  correlated with perturbances of normal rhythmic HRV. Nevertheless, the DD ACE  genotype was associated with increased HRV (p {\textless}0.05), whereas angiotensinogen  polymorphisms had no effect. We conclude that HRV and related parameters are in  part heritable. Interestingly, the DD ACE genotype is associated with increased  HRV.},

HRV, BPV, and BRS parameters were obtained from animal  studies designed to study pathogenetic mechanisms of distinct cardiovascular  diseases. Different non-linear approaches for HRV and BPV analysis are presented  here, in particular measures of complexity based on symbolic dynamics. The dual  sequence method (DSM) was employed for BRS analysis. In comparison to the  classical measure of BRS using the average slope [ms/mm Hg], DSM offers  additional information about the time-variant coupling between BPV and HRV. Since  cardiovascular regulation shares common features among different species, data on  HRV and BPV, as well as BRS, in animal models might be useful for understanding  the pathogenetic mechanisms of cardiovascular diseases in humans and in the  development of new diagnostic approaches.},

The study is based on the  hypothesis that alterations in cardiovascular regulatory behavior can be used to  predict PE. Ninety-six pregnant women in whom Doppler investigation detected  perfusion disorders of the uterine arteries were included in the study.  Twenty-four of these pregnant women developed PE after the 30th week of  gestation. During pregnancy, additional several noninvasive continuous blood  pressure recordings were made over 30 min under resting conditions by means of a  finger cuff. The time series extracted of systolic as well as diastolic  beat-to-beat pressures and the heart rate were studied by variability and  coupling analysis to find predictive factors preceding genesis of the disease. In  the period between the 18th and 26th weeks of pregnancy, three special  variability and baroreflex parameters were able to predict PE several weeks  before clinical manifestation. Discriminant function analysis of these parameters  was able to predict PE with a sensitivity and specificity of 87.5\% and a positive  predictive value of 70\%.

Feature extraction, selection and classification stages were  applied to analyze blood oxygen saturation (SaO2) recordings in order to simplify  polysomnography (PSG), the gold standard diagnostic methodology for SAHS.  Statistical, spectral and nonlinear measures were computed to compose the initial  feature set. Principal component analysis (PCA), forward stepwise feature  selection (FSFS) and genetic algorithms (GAs) were applied to select feature  subsets. Fisher's linear discriminant (FLD), logistic regression (LR) and support  vector machines (SVMs) were applied in the classification stage. Optimum  classification algorithms from each combination of these feature selection and  classification approaches were prospectively validated on datasets from two  independent sleep units. FSFS + LR achieved the highest diagnostic performance  using a small feature subset (4 features), reaching 83.2\% accuracy in the  validation set and 88.7\% accuracy in the test set. Similarly, GAs + SVM also  achieved high generalization capability using a small number of input features (7  features), with 84.2\% accuracy on the validation set and 84.5\% accuracy in the  test set. Our results suggest that reduced subsets of complementary features (25\%  to 50\% of total features) and classifiers with high generalization ability could  provide high-performance screening tools in the context of SAHS.},

Plasma ACE2 activity was significantly  increased in DCM patients, correlating with clinical severity. It was correlating  with echocardiographic parameters in patients with DCM. Furthermore, plasma ACE2  activity had the potency to predict cardiac death and heart transplantation.  However, compared with patients with Chagas' disease, the correlation and  predictive value of ACE2 activity in patients with DCM was much less pronounced.  Beta blocker treatment in patients with DCM was identified to prevent the  association between circulating ACE2 activity and echocardiographic parameters.  Although ACE2 activity in blood samples of patients with DCM without beta  blockers is potent in correlating with the severity of disease and in predicting  death and heart transplantation, its correlation and prediction potency are  significantly diminished by beta blocker treatment.},

Early  prediction is still insufficient in clinical practice. Although most  pre-eclamptic patients have pathological uterine perfusion in the second  trimester, perfusion disturbance has a positive predictive accuracy (PPA) only of  approximately 30\%. METHODS: Non-invasive continuous blood pressure recordings  were taken simultaneously via a finger cuff for 30 min. Time series of systolic  as well as diastolic beat-to-beat pressure values were extracted to analyse heart  rate and blood pressure variability and baroreflex sensitivity in 102  second-trimester pregnancies, to assess predictability for pre-eclampsia (n =  16). All women underwent Doppler investigations of the uterine arteries. RESULTS:  We identified a combination of three variability and baroreflex parameters to  best predict pre-eclampsia several weeks before clinical manifestation. The  discriminant function of these three parameters classified patients with later  pre-eclampsia with a sensitivity of 87.5\%, a specificity of 83.7\%, and a PPA of  50.0\%. Combined with Doppler investigations of uterine arteries, PPA increased to  71.4\%.

This study investigates the suitability of short-term  heart rate turbulence (HRT) analysis in comparison to heart rate and blood  pressure variability as well as baroreceptor sensitivity analyses to characterise  the regulatory differences between patients with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) and  healthy controls. In this study, 30 minutes data of non-invasive continuous blood  pressure and ECGs of 37 DCM patients and 167 controls measured under standard  resting conditions were analysed. The results show highly significant differences  between DCM patients and controls in heart rate and blood pressure variability as  well as in baroreceptor sensitivity parameters. Applying a combined heart  rate-blood pressure trigger, ventricular premature beats were detected in 24.3\%  (9) of the DCM patients and 11.3\% (19) of the controls. This fact demonstrates  the limited applicability of short-term HRT analyses. However, the HRT parameters  showed significant differences in this subgroup with ventricular premature beats  (turbulence onset: DCM: 1.80+/-2.72, controls: - 4.34+/-3.10, p{\textless}0.001; turbulence  slope: DCM: 6.75+/-5.50, controls: 21.30+/-17.72, p=0.021). Considering all  (including HRT) parameters in the subgroup with ventricular beats, a  discrimination rate between DCM patients and controls of 88.0\% was obtained (max.  6 parameters). The corresponding value obtained for the total group was 86.3\%  (without HRT parameters). Comparable classification rates and high correlations  between heart rate turbulence and variability and baroreflex parameters point to  a more universal applicability of the latter methods.},

A significant genetic influence on heart rate variability is suggested, although  the genes involved are ill-defined. The Mas-protooncogene encodes a  G-protein-coupled receptor with seven transmembrane domains highly expressed in  testis and brain. Since this receptor is supposed to interact with the signaling  of angiotensin II, which is an important regulator of cardiovascular homeostasis,  heart rate and blood pressure were analyzed in Mas-deficient mice. Using a  femoral catheter the blood pressure of mice was measured for a period of 30 min  and 250 data values per second were recorded. The mean values and range of heart  rate and blood pressure were then calculated. Neither heart rate nor blood  pressure were significantly different between knockout mice and controls.  However, high resolution recording of these parameters and analysis of the data  by non-linear dynamics revealed significant alterations in cardiovascular  variability in Mas-deficient animals. In particular, females showed a strong  reduction of heart rate variability. Furthermore, the data showed an increased  sympathetic tone in knockout animals of both genders. The marked alterations  detected in Mas-deficient mice of both genders suggest that the Mas-protooncogene  is an important determinant of heart rate and blood pressure variability.},

In this  study, standard time domain, frequency domain and non-linear dynamics measures of  HRV assessment were applied to 572 survivors of acute myocardial infarction.  Three parameter sets each consisting of 4 parameters were applied and compared  with the standard measurement of global heart rate variability HRVi. Discriminant  analysis technique and t-test were performed to separate the high risk groups  from the survivors. The predictive value of this approach was evaluated with  receiver operator (ROC) and positive predictive accuracy (PPA) curves.  Results--The discriminant analysis shows a separation of patients suffered by all  cause mortality in 80\% (best single parameter 74\%) and sudden arrhythmic death in  86\% (73\%). All parameters of set 1 show a high significant difference (p {\textless} 0.001)  between survivors and non-survivors based on two-tailed t-test. The specificity  level of the multivariate parameter sets is at the 70\% sensitivity level (ROC)  about 85-90\%, whereas HRVi shows maximum levels of 70\%. The PPA in the all cause  mortality group is at the 70\% sensitivity level twice as high as the univariate  HRV measure and increases to more than fourfold as high within the VT/VF group.  In conclusion, in this population, the multiparametric approach with the  combination of four parameters from all domains especially from NLD seems to be a  better predictor of high arrhythmia risk than the standard measurement of global  heart rate variability.},

This study investigates the suitability of shortterm heart  rate turbulence (HRT) in comparison to heart rate and blood pressure variability  as well as baroreceptor sensitivity analyses to characterize the regulatory  differences in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) and healthy controls.  In this study, 30 minutes data from noninvasive continuous blood pressure and ECG  of 37 DCM patients and 167 controls under standard resting conditions were  analyzed. The results showed highly significant differences between DCM patients  and controls in heart rate and blood pressure variability as well as baroreceptor  sensitivity parameters. Applying a combined heart rate-blood pressure trigger, in  24.3\% (9) of the DCM patients and in 11.3\% (19) of the controls ventricular  premature beats were detected. This fact demonstrates the constricted  applicability of short-term HRT analyses. However, the HRT parameters showed  significant differences in this subgroup with ventricular premature beats  (Turbulence Onset: DCM: 1.80+/-2.72, CONTROLS: -4.34+/-3.10, p{\textless}0.001; Turbulence  Slope: DCM: 6.75+/-5.50, CONTROLS: 21.30+/-17.72, p = 0.021). Considering all  (including HRT) parameters in the subgroup with ventricular beats, a  discrimination rate between DCM patients and controls of 88.0\% was obtained (max.  6 parameters). In comparison, in the total group this rate was 86.3\% (without HRT  parameters). The comparable classification rates and the high correlations  between heart rate turbulence and variability and baroreflex parameters point to  a more universal applicability of the last-mentioned methods.},

	abstract = {The traditional analysis of heart rate variability (HRV) in the time and frequency domains seems to be an independent predictive marker for sudden cardiac  death. Because the usual applied methods of HRV analysis describe only linear or  strong periodic phenomena, the authors have developed new methods of HRV analysis  based on nonlinear dynamics. In that way, parameters are extracted that quantify  more complex processes and their complicated relationships. These methods are  symbolic dynamics that describes the beat-to-beat dynamics and renormalized  entropy that compares the complexity of power spectra on a normalized energy  level. In an initial investigation, the HRV of 35 healthy subjects and 39 cardiac  patients have been analyzed. Using discriminant functions, the authors found an  optimal (100\%) differentiation between the group of healthy subjects (even using  only an age-matched subgroup of 12 subjects) and that of patients after  myocardial infarction with a high electrical risk (Lown 4b). Applying this  discriminant function to a group of patients with low electrical risk, four  patients show the same behavior indicative of a high risk score, which might be a  sign for a hidden high risk, two patients show healthy behavior, and the  remaining patients show a separate pattern. The use of new methods of nonlinear  dynamics in combination with parameters of the time and frequency domains in HRV  offers possibilities for improved classification of HRV behavior. It is suggested  that this could lead to a more detailed classification of individual high risk.},

In  this study we tested the hypothesis that patients with DCM and controls show a  different behavior in the baroreflex (BR) regulation. In contrast to other  methods, the new dual sequence method (DSM) analyzes the baroreflex sensitivity  (BRS) as a response of the heart rate (interbeat interval, IBI) on dual  spontaneous fluctuations of blood pressure (BP). The DSM includes the analysis of  bradycardiac fluctuations (an increase of BP causes an increase of IBI) and  tachycardiac fluctuations (decrease of BP causes a decrease of IBI) to obtain  enhanced information about the sympathetic-vagal regulation. DCM patients show a  40-50\% lower number of correlated blood pressure-heart rate fluctuations (DCM  patients: male 154 +/- 93, female 93 +/- 40 vs. control group: m 245 +/- 112, f  150 +/- 55, p {\textless} 0.05). The BRS in DCM patients is significantly lower than in  controls (5.2 +/- 1.9 vs. 8.0 +/- 5.4 (ms/mm Hg), p {\textless} 0.05). Using the DSM the  discriminant function analysis (6 parameters) classifies correctly 84\% of DCM  patients and the control group. Using the classical sequence method, only 76\%  were correctly classified. The DSM is a useful method for analyzing the BRS based  on the spontaneous BR to obtain an increased classification of patients with DCM.  BRS in patients with DCM is significantly reduced and apparently more  ineffective.},

Because it is  known that altered maternal sFlt1 and placental growth factor levels are  detectable weeks before the onset of these pregnancy complications, it was the  aim of the study to investigate the predictive value of these markers in  high-risk second trimester pregnancies characterized by abnormal uterine  perfusion. This prospective study includes 63 second trimester pregnant women  with abnormal uterine perfusion. Twenty five of them developed a later  complication (12 with preeclampsia, 11 with intrauterine growth restriction, and  2 with intrauterine death), whereas 38 had a normal course of pregnancy.  Pregnancies with adverse pregnancy outcome showed in the second trimester  significantly higher sFlt1 (1403.6+/-555 versus 451.8+/-42 pg/mL; P{\textless}0.05) and  lower placental growth factor (139.6+/-24 versus 184.1+/-21 pg/mL) levels  compared with those with normal outcome. These alterations were more pronounced  in pregnancies with subsequent preeclampsia compared with intrauterine growth  restriction and early onset diseases (delivery {\textless}34 weeks) compared with  late-onset diseases. The combination of Doppler and sFlt1 increases the  sensitivity of Doppler alone for iatrogenic preterm delivery from 64\% up to 79\%  and the specificity from 63\% up to 80\%. Using both factors, sFlt1 and placental  growth factor, early onset preeclampsia can be predicted with 83\% sensitivity and  95\% specificity. We conclude that the concurrent measurement of uterine perfusion  and angiogenic factors allows an efficient prediction of early onset pregnancy  complications, particularly preeclampsia.},

	abstract = {In the last decade, there has been an increasing interest in compensating thermally induced errors to improve the manufacturing accuracy of modular tool  systems. These modular tool systems are interfaces between spindle and workpiece  and consist of several complicatedly formed parts. Their thermal behavior is  dominated by nonlinearities, delay and hysteresis effects even in tools with  simpler geometry and it is difficult to describe it theoretically. Due to the  dominant nonlinear nature of this behavior the so far used linear regression  between the temperatures and the displacements is insufficient. Therefore, in  this study we test the hypothesis whether we can reliably predict such thermal  displacements via nonlinear temperature-displacement regression functions. These  functions are estimated first from learning measurements using the alternating  conditional expectation (ACE) algorithm and then tested on independent data sets.  First, we analyze data that were generated by a finite element spindle model. We  find that our approach is a powerful tool to describe the relation between  temperatures and displacements for simulated data. Next, we analyze the  temperature-displacement relationship in a silent real experimental setup, where  the tool system is thermally forced. Again, the ACE algorithm is powerful to  estimate the deformation with high precision. The corresponding errors obtained  by using the nonlinear regression approach are 10-fold lower in comparison to  multiple linear regression analysis. Finally, we investigate the thermal behavior  of a modular tool system in a working milling machine and again get promising  results. The thermally induced errors can be estimated with 1-2 microm accuracy  using this nonlinear regression analysis. Therefore, this approach seems to be  very useful for the development of new modular tool systems.},

From all twins, long-term electrocardiographic  records were obtained, edited, and analyzed. Heart rate variability analysis was  performed on the basis of parameters from time-domain, frequency-domain, and  nonlinear dynamics. First, the parameter distances between the two twins of a  pair and between one of the two and a third randomly selected person of another  age-matched twin pair (ST1) were compared. Second, the parameter distances  between the two twins and the averaged parameter distances of these two twins to  all other age-matched persons (ST2) were compared. Finally, the averaged  differences in parameter values between monozygotic and dizygotic age-matched  twin pairs were compared. For statistical analysis, the nonparametric Wilcoxon's  matched-pair signed rank test and parametric t-test for paired samples were used.  Twin pairs show a significant lower difference in parameter values than other  randomly selected and age-matched couples (P {\textless} .001 in ST1 and ST2). This  reflects a considerable familial influence. Most parameters of the time-domain,  none of the frequency-domain, and half of the nonlinear dynamics show significant  differences between twin pairs and nontwin pairs. As a result of the comparison  between monozygotic and dizygotic twin pairs, a significant lower parameter  difference in the monozygotic pairs (P {\textless} .05) is found. These results suggest  that there is a genetic component in heart rate generation and HRV, in addition  to family environmental influences.

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: This study introduces new methods of non-linear dynamics (NLD) and compares these with traditional methods of heart rate variability (HRV) and high  resolution ECG (HRECG) analysis in order to improve the reliability of high risk  stratification. METHODS: Simultaneous 30 min high resolution ECG's and long-term  ECG's were recorded from 26 cardiac patients after myocardial infarction (MI).  They were divided into two groups depending upon the electrical risk, a low risk  group (group 2, n = 10) and a high risk group (group 3, n = 16). The control  group consisted of 35 healthy persons (group 1). From these electrocardiograms we  extracted standard measures in time and frequency domain as well as measures from  the new non-linear methods of symbolic dynamics and renormalized entropy.  RESULTS: Applying discriminant function techniques on HRV analysis the parameters  of non-linear dynamics led to an acceptable differentiation between healthy  persons and high risk patients of 96\%. The time domain and frequency domain  parameters were successful in less than 90\%. The combination of parameters from  all domains and a stepwise discriminant function separated these groups  completely (100\%). Use of this discriminant function classified three patients  with apparently low (no) risk into the same cluster as high risk patients. The  combination of the HRECG and HRV analysis showed the same individual clustering  but increased the positive value of separation. CONCLUSIONS: The methods of NLD  describe complex rhythm fluctuations and separate structures of non-linear  behavior in the heart rate time series more successfully than classical methods  of time and frequency domains. This leads to an improved discrimination between a  normal (healthy persons) and an abnormal (high risk patients) type of heart beat  generation. Some patients with an unknown risk exhibit similar patterns to high  risk patients and this suggests a hidden high risk. The methods of symbolic  dynamics and renormalized entropy were particularly useful measures for  classifying the dynamics of HRV.},

This study aimed at  investigating BRS in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) and in healthy  subjects (controls), as well as comparing the values of BRS parameters with  parameters of heart rate variability (HRV) and blood pressure variability (BPV).  ECG, continuous blood pressure and respiration curves were recorded for 30 min in  27 DCM patients and 27 control subjects. The Dual Sequence Method (DSM) includes  the analysis of spontaneous fluctuations in systolic blood pressure and the  corresponding beat-to-beat intervals of heart rate to estimate bradycardic,  opposite tachycardic and delayed baroreflex fluctuations. The number of systolic  blood pressure/beat-to-beat interval fluctuations in DCM patients was reduced in  comparison with controls (DCM patients: male, 154.4+/-93.9 ms/mmHg; female,  93.7+/-40.5 ms/mmHg; controls: male, 245.5+/-112.9 ms/mmHg; female, 150.6+/-55.8  ms/mmHg, P{\textless}0.05). The average slope in DCM patients was lower than in controls  (DCM, 5.3+/-1.9 ms/mmHg; controls, 8.0+/-5.4 ms/mmHg; P{\textless}0.05). Discriminant  function analysis showed that, in the synchronous range of the standard sequence  method, the DCM and control groups could be discriminated to only 76\% accuracy,  whereas the DSM gave an improved accuracy of 84\%. The combination of six  parameters of HRV, BPV and DSM gives an accuracy of classification of 96\%,  whereas six parameters of HRV and BPV could separate the two groups to only 88\%  accuracy. Thus the DSM leads to an improved characterization of autonomous  regulation in order to differentiate between DCM patients and healthy subjects.  BRS in DCM patients is significantly reduced and apparently less effective.},

The large-scale dimension density  (LASDID) is estimated from the time series using a normalized  Grassberger-Procaccia algorithm, which leads to a suitable correction of  systematic errors produced by boundary effects in the rather large scales of a  system. This way, it is possible to analyze rather short, nonstationary, and  unfiltered data, such as HRV. Moreover, this method allows us to analyze short  parts of the data and to look for differences between day and night. The  circadian changes in the dimension density enable us to distinguish almost  completely between real data and computer-generated data from the CiC 2002  challenge using only one parameter. In the second part we analyzed the data of 15  patients with atrial fibrillation (AF), 15 patients with congestive heart failure  (CHF), 15 elderly healthy subjects (EH), as well as 18 young and healthy persons  (YH). With our method we are able to separate completely the AF (rho (mu/ls) =  0.97 +/- 0.02) group from the others and, especially during daytime, the CHF  patients show significant differences from the young and elderly healthy  volunteers (CHF, 0.65 +/- 0.13; EH, 0.54 +/- 0.05; YH, 0.57 +/- 0.05; p {\textless} 0.05  for both comparisons). Moreover, for the CHF patients we find no circadian  changes in rho (mu/ls) (day, 0.65 +/- 0.13; night, 0.66 +/- 0.12; n.s.) in  contrast to healthy controls (day, 0.54 +/- 0.05; night, 0.61 +/- 0.05; p=0.002).  Correlation analysis showed no statistical significant relation between standard  HRV and circadian LASDID, demonstrating a possibly independent application of our  method for clinical risk stratification.},

The strength of the correlation is controlled by a tunable parameter a  that interpolates the classical car parking problem at a=0, the ballistic  deposition at a=1, and the CBD model at a{\textgreater}1. The effects of the correlation in  the CBD model are as follows. The jamming coverage q(a) increases with the  strength of attraction a due to an ever-increasing tendency of cluster formation.  The system almost reaches the closest packing structure as a--{\textgreater}infinity but never  forms a percolating cluster, which is typical of one-dimensional systems. In the  large a regime, the mean cluster size k increases as a(1/2). Furthermore, the  asymptotic approach towards the closest packing is purely algebraic both with a  as q(infinity)-q(a) approximately a(-1/2) and with k as q(infinity)-q(k)  approximately k(-1), where q(infinity) approximately 1.},

The most efficient therapy  for SCD prevention are implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICD). In this  study heart rate variability (HRV) measures were analyzed for short-term  forecasting of VT in order to improve VT sensing and to enable a patient warning  of forth-coming shocks. METHODS: The last 1000 normal beat-to-beat intervals  before 50 VT episodes stored by the ICD were analyzed and compared to  individually acquired control time series (CON). HRV analysis was performed with  standard parameters of time and frequency domain as suggested by the HRV Task  Force and furthermore with a newly developed and optimized nonlinear parameter  that assesses the compression entropy of heart rate (Hc). RESULTS: Except of  meanNN (p = 0.02) we found no significant differences in standard HRV parameters.  In contrast, Hc revealed highly significant (p = 0.007) alterations in VT  compared with CON suggesting a decreased complexity before the onset of VT.  CONCLUSION: Compression entropy might be a suitable parameter for short-term  forecasting of life-threatening tachycardia in ICD.},

HRV analysis is performed with standard parameters of time and frequency domain  as suggested by the HRV Task Force. For scaling analyses of heart rate time  series, the fractal dimension is analysed, applying Higuchi's algorithm (HFD).  Furthermore, detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) is performed. None of the  standard HRV parameters shows significant differences between CON and VT. Before  the onset of VT, the scaling characteristics by means of HFD and DFA are  significantly changed.

This study aims at investigating the time dependent alterations in cardiovascular  control to find new predictive parameters for arrhythmic events after surgery. 25  male patients with coronary heart disease following an aortocoronary bypass  surgery were examined. The results show significant alterations in sympathetic  and vagal mediated regulation. The extubation after 6 hours seems to influence  primarily the sympathetic activation. Obviously, there is a vagal suppression 20  h after surgery, while the sympathetic tonus works in a normal range. This  unbalanced interaction of the autonomous system seems to be a reason for the high  incidence of atrial tachycardias in the early period after cardiac surgery.},

The application of these new methods  should therefore lead to an improved identification of high-risk patients.
