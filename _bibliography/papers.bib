	abstract = {The fetal ECG derived from abdominal leads is an interesting alternative to standard fetal heart monitoring methods. Due to the temporal and spectral overlap of maternal and fetal signals, the usage of abdominal leads requires elaborated signal processing routines. In this work a modular combination of processing techniques is presented. The core of the evaluated scheme consists of two maternal ECG estimation techniques, namely the Extended Kalman Smoother (EKS) and Template Adaption (TA). Different method combinations are compared using the Computing in Cardiology Challenge 2013's scoring system. The obtained results prove that the proposed methods produce reliable fetal heart rate estimates. For training Set-A we obtained scores of 9.90/2.98 (Event 4/5) for TA, 196/6.78 for EKS and 15.7/3.25 combined versions of each method. For Set-B the best scores (18.1/4.38) were produced by TA in combination with statistical postprocessing.},

	abstract = {The analysis of effects from coupling in and between systems is important in data-driven investigations as practiced in many scientific fields. It allows deeper insights into the mechanisms of interaction emerging among individual smaller systems when forming complex systems as in the human circulatory system. For systems featuring various regimes, usually only the epochs before and after a transition between different regimes are analyzed, although relevant information might be hidden within these transitions. Transient behavior of cardiovascular variables may emerge, on the one hand, from the recovery of the system after a severe disturbance or, on the other hand, from adaptive behavior throughout changes of states. It contains important information about the processes involved and the relations between state variables such as heart rate, blood pressure, and respiration. Therefore, we apply an ensemble approach to extend the method of symbolic coupling traces to time-variant coupling analysis. These new ensemble symbolic coupling traces are capable of determining coupling direction, strength, and time offset τ from transient dynamics in multivariate cardiovascular data. We use this method to analyze data recorded during an orthostatic test to reveal a transient structure that cannot be detected by classic methods.},

Objective: The aim of this study was to identify the most sensitive heart rate and blood pressure variability (HRV and BPV) parameters from a given set of well-known methods for the quantification of cardiovascular autonomic function after several autonomic blockades. Methods: Cardiovascular sympathetic and parasympathetic functions were studied in freely moving rats following peripheral muscarinic (methylatropine), ß1-adrenergic (metoprolol), muscarinic + ß1-adrenergic, a1-adrenergic (prazosin), and ganglionic (hexamethonium) blockades. Time domain, frequency domain and symbolic dynamics measures for each of HRV and BPV were classified through paired Wilcoxon test for all autonomic drugs separately. In order to select those variables that have a high relevan ce to, and stable influence on our target measurements (HRV, BPV) we used Fisher's Method to combine the p-value of multiple tests. Results: This analysis led to the following best set of cardiovascular variability parameters: The mean normal beat-to-beat-interval/value (HRV/BPV: meanNN), the coefficient of variation (cvNN = standard deviation over meanNN) and the root mean square differences of successive (RMSSD) of the time domain analysis. In frequency domain analysis the very-low-frequency (VLF) component was selected. From symbolic dynamics Shannon entropy of the word distribution (FWSHANNON) as well as POLVAR3, the non-linear parameter to detect intermittently decreased variability, showed the best ability to discriminate between the different autonomic blockades. Conclusion: Throughout a complex comparative analysis of HRV and BPV measures altered by a set of autonomic drugs, we identified the most sensitive set of informative cardiovascular variability indexes able to pick up the modifications imposed by the autonomic challenges. These indexes may help to increase our understanding of cardiovascular sympathetic and parasympathetic functions in translational studies of experimental diseases.},

OBJECTIVE: To study the association between the risk of de novo device-detected atrial fibrillation (AF), the autonomic perturbations before the onset of paroxysmal AF and a seven-days heart rate variability (7dHRV) one month after ICD implantation. METHODS: The registry consists of 234 patients implanted with an ICD, including 10 with de novo long-lasting atrial tachyarrhythmias with no prior history of AF. The patients were matched via the propensity-score methodology as well as for properties directly influencing the ECGs recorded using GE CardioMem CM 3000. Heart rate variability (HRV) analysis was performed using standard parameters from time- and frequency-domains, and from non-linear dynamics. RESULTS: No linear HRV was associated with an increased risk of AF (p=n.s.). The only significant approach was derived from symbolic dynamics with the parameter 'forbidden words' which distinguished both groups on all seven days of measurements (p\&lt;0.05), thereby quantifying the heart rate complexity (HRC) as drastically lower in the de novo AF group. CONCLUSION: Cardiac autonomic dysfunction denoted by low HRC may be associated with higher AF incidence. For patients with mild to moderate heart failure, standard HRV parameters are not appropriate to quantify cardiac autonomic perturbations before the onset of AF. Further studies are needed to determine the individual risk for AF that would enable interventions to restore autonomic balance in the general population.},

	abstract = {Cardiovascular diseases are the main source of morbidity and mortality in the United States with costs of more than \$170 billion. Repetitive respiratory disorders during sleep are assumed to be a major cause of these diseases. Therefore, the understanding of the cardio-respiratory regulation during these events is of high public interest. One of the governing mechanisms is the mutual influence of the cardiac and respiratory oscillations on their respective onsets, the cardio-respiratory coordination (CRC). We analyze this mechanism based on nocturnal measurements of 27 males suffering from obstructive sleep apnea syndrome. Here we find, by using an advanced analysis technique, the coordigram, not only that the occurrence of CRC is significantly more frequent during respiratory sleep disturbances than in normal respiration (p-value{\textless}10−51) but also more frequent after these events (p-value{\textless}10−15). Especially, the latter finding contradicts the common assumption that spontaneous CRC can only be observed in epochs of relaxed conditions, while our newly discovered epochs of CRC after disturbances are characterized by high autonomic stress. Our findings on the connection between CRC and the appearance of sleep-disordered events require a substantial extension of the current understanding of obstructive sleep apneas and hypopneas.},

	abstract = {Heart rate and blood pressure variability analysis as well as baroreflex sensitivity have been proven to be powerful tools for the assessment of autonomic control in clinical practice. Their ability to detect systematic changes caused by different states, diseases and treatments shall be shown for sleep disorders. Therefore, we consider 18 normotensive and 10 hypertensive patients suffering from obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) before and after a three-month continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy. Additionally, an age and sex matched control group of 10 healthy subjects is examined. Linear and nonlinear parameters of heart rate and blood pressure fluctuation as well as the baroreflex sensitivity are used to answer the question whether there are differences in cardiovascular regulation between the different sleep stages and groups. Moreover, the therapeutic effect of CPAP therapy in OSAS patients shall be investigated. Kruskal-Wallis tests between the sleep stages for each group show significant differences in the very low spectral component of heart rate (VLF/P: 0.0033–0.04 Hz, p\&lt;0.01) which indicates differences in metabolic activity during the night. Furthermore, the decrease of Shannon entropy of word distribution as a parameter of systolic blood pressure during non-REM sleep reflects the local dominance of the vagal system (p\&lt;0.05). The increased sympathetic activation of the patients leads to clear differences of cardiovascular regulation in different sleep stages between controls and patients. We found a significant reduction of baroreflex sensitivity in slow wave sleep in the OSAS patients (Mann-Whitney test, p\&lt;0.05) compared to controls, which disappeared after three months of CPAP therapy. Hence, our results demonstrate the ability of cardiovascular analyzes to separate between healthy and pathological regulation as well as between different severities of OSAS in this retrospective study.},

	abstract = {Cardiorespiratory phase synchronisation (CRS) is a type of cardiorespiratory coupling that manifests through a prediliction for heart beats to occur at specific points relative to the phase of the respiratory cycle. It has been under investigation for nearly 20 years, and while it seems to be mostly occurring in relaxed states such as deep sleep and anesthesia, no clear clinical implications have been established. Cardiorespiratory coordination (CRC) is a recent development in this field where the relationship between the respiratory onset and heart beat is analysed in the time domain and the possible relationship of each heart beat is considered for both the previous and the next respiratory onset. This ostensibly closely related effect must not only show relevant information content but also do so independent of CRS in order to be relevant for future studies. In this paper, we investigate CRC and its relation to CRS mainly using graphical and statistical methods on two exemplary datasets: measurements from a pregnant woman participating in a preeclampsia study and those from a man suffering from sleep apnea. We show fundamental differences between the results of both approaches and are able to show a formerly unknown dependency between the heart activity and respiratory rate, potentially indicating heartbeat-initiated inspiration. Despite their differences, methods developed for the quantification of CRS can be adapted to CRC. Completing the comparison is an investigation into the relationship between CRC and respiratory sinus arrhythmia. Similar to previous results for CRS, the two effects are found to be orthogonal, meaning that they can be observed independently or in conjunction.},

The number one cause of death worldwide today originates in cardiovascular diseases. For these reasons the aim of understanding the functions and the interactions of the cardiovascular system is and has been a major research topic throughout various disciplines for more than a hundred years. The purpose of most of today's research is to get as much information as possible with the lowest possible effort and the least discomfort for the subject or patient, e.g. via non-invasive measurements. A family of tools whose importance has been growing during the last years is known under the headline of coupling measures. The rationale for this kind of analysis is to identify the structure of interactions in a system of multiple components. Important information lies for example in the coupling direction, the coupling strength, and occurring time lags. In this work, we will, after a brief general introduction covering the development of cardiovascular time series analysis, introduce, explain and review some of the most important coupling measures and classify them according to their origin and capabilities in the light of physiological analyses. We will begin with classical correlation measures, go via Granger-causality-based tools, entropy-based techniques (e.g. momentary information transfer), nonlinear prediction measures (e.g. mutual prediction) to symbolic dynamics (e.g. symbolic coupling traces). All these methods have contributed important insights into physiological interactions like cardiorespiratory coupling, neuro-cardio-coupling and many more. Furthermore,},

Therefore, we introduce linear and nonlinear variables, namely Cepstrum Coefficients (CC), Filterbanks (Fbank) and Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (DFA). Logistic Regression, Linear Discriminant Analysis and Quadratic Discriminant Analysis were used for classification purposes. The experiments were carried out using two databases. We achieved a per-segment accuracy of 84.76\% (sensitivity = 81.45\%, specificity = 86.82\%, AUC = 0.92) in the Apnea-ECG Physionet database, whereas in the HuGCDN2014 database, provided by the Dr. Negrín University Hospital (Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, Spain), the best results were: accuracy = 81.96\%, sensitivity = 70.95\%, specificity = 85.47\%, AUC = 0.87. The former results were comparable or better than those obtained by other methods for the same database in the recent literature. We have concluded that the selected features that best characterize the underlying process are common to both databases. This supports the fact that the conclusions reached are potentially generalizable. The best results were obtained when the three kinds of features were jointly used. Another notable fact is the small number of features needed to describe the phenomenon. Results suggest that the two first Fbanks, the first CC and the first DFA coefficient are the variables that best describe the RR pattern in OSA and, therefore, are especially relevant to extract discriminative information for apnea screening purposes.},

As complements to EEG, EOG, and EMG, these signals provide diagnostic information for autonomic nervous activity during sleep. This review presents major methodological developments in sleep research regarding heart rate, ECG, and cardio-respiratory couplings in a chronological (historical) sequence. It presents physiological and pathophysiological insights related to sleep medicine obtained by new technical developments. Recorded nocturnal ECG facilitates conventional heart rate variability (HRV) analysis, studies of cyclical variations of heart rate, and analysis of ECG waveform. In healthy adults, the autonomous nervous system is regulated in totally different ways during wakefulness, slow-wave sleep, and REM sleep. Analysis of beat-to-beat heart-rate variations with statistical methods enables us to estimate sleep stages based on the differences in autonomic nervous system regulation. Furthermore, up to some degree, it is possible to track transitions from wakefulness to sleep by analysis of heart-rate variations. ECG and heart rate analysis allow assessment of selected sleep disorders as well. Sleep disordered breathing can be detected reliably by studying cyclical variation of heart rate combined with respiration-modulated changes in ECG morphology (amplitude of R wave and T wave).},

In a subset of patients, increased heart rate and reduced heart rate variability was often observed up to 20 min prior to the VT. There was a non-significant trend to higher incidence of premature ventricular complexes (PVCs) before VT compared to control recordings. The patterns of the ventricular arrhythmias were highly heterogeneous among different patients and even within the same patient. Analysis of the changes of heart rate and heart rate variability may have predictive value about the onset of VT in selected patients. The patterns of ventricular arrhythmia could not be used to predict onset of VT in this group of patients.},

These novel approaches improved the technical understanding of the HRV signal; however, their success in clinical applications, such as in the identification of high-risk patients, has been rather limited. Therefore, in this letter, we present one possible ex-planation for this limited success that merits additional attention: the importance of moni-toring respiration for the interpretation of standard HRV analysis and the need to address its complexities using improved signal pro-cessing methods. In a case report of this issue, 3 we introduced a 20-year-old woman who had a non-sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT). Cardiac autonomic function was evaluated via standard HRV analysis which found a remarkably increased power in the low-frequency (LF) band in the resting state. Standard interpretation would suggest an in-creased sympathetic activity. In this case report, we additionally looked for respiration. This arose from our experi-ence in this matter that also led to us answer-ing the question raised by Lean Glass 'Is the normal heart rate chaotic?' (Reference 45 in 1},

This study investigates the suitability of short-term heart rate turbulence (HRT) analysis in comparison to heart rate and blood pressure variability as well as baroreceptor sensitivity analyses to characterise the regulatory differences between patients with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) and healthy controls. In this study, 30 minutes data of non-invasive continuous blood pressure and ECGs of 37 DCM patients and 167 controls measured under standard resting conditions were analysed. The results show highly significant differences between DCM patients and controls in heart rate and blood pressure variability as well as in baroreceptor sensitivity parameters. Applying a combined heart rate-blood pressure trigger, ventricular premature beats were detected in 24.3\% (9) of the DCM patients and 11.3\% (19) of the controls. This fact demonstrates the limited applicability of short-term HRT analyses. However, the HRT parameters showed significant differences in this subgroup with ventricular premature beats (turbulence onset: DCM: 1.80+/-2.72, controls: - 4.34+/-3.10, p{\textless}0.001; turbulence slope: DCM: 6.75+/-5.50, controls: 21.30+/-17.72, p=0.021). Considering all (including HRT) parameters in the subgroup with ventricular beats, a discrimination rate between DCM patients and controls of 88.0\% was obtained (max. 6 parameters). The corresponding value obtained for the total group was 86.3\% (without HRT parameters). Comparable classification rates and high correlations between heart rate turbulence and variability and baroreflex parameters point to a more universal applicability of the latter methods.},

The aim of this study was to investigate the differences in HRV estimated from continuous blood pressure (BP) measurement by different methods in comparison to electrocardiogram (ECG) signals. The beat-to-beat intervals (BBI) were simultaneously extracted from the ECG and blood pressure of 9 cardiac patients (10 min, Colin system, 1000-Hz sampling frequency). For both data types, slope, peak, and correlation detection algorithms were applied. The short-term variability was calculated using concurrent 10-min BP and ECG segments. The root mean square errors in comparison to ECG slope detection were: 1.74 ms for ECG correlation detection; 5.42 ms for ECG peak detection; 5.45 ms for BP slope detection; 5.75 ms for BP correlation detection; and 11.96 ms for BP peak detection. Our results show that the variability obtained with ECG is the most reliable. Moreover, slope detection is superior to peak detection and slightly superior to correlation detection. In particular, for ECG signals with higher frequency characteristics, peak detection often exhibits more artificial variability. Besides measurement noise, respiratory modulation and pulse transit time play an important role in determining BBI. The slope detection method applied to ECG should be preferred, because it is more robust as regards morphological changes in the signals, as well as physiological properties. As the ECG is not recorded in most animal studies, distal pulse wave measurement in combination with correlation or slope detection may be considered an acceptable alternative.},

Based on recordings of brain waves and the analysis of characteristic patterns and waveforms it is possible to distinguish wakefulness and five sleep stages. Sleep and the sleep stages modulate autonomous nervous system functions such as body temperature, respiration, blood pressure, and heart rate. These functions consist of a sympathetic tone usually related to activation and to parasympathetic (or vagal) tone usually related to inhibition. Methods of statistical physics are used to analyze heart rate and respiration to detect changes of the autonomous nervous system during sleep. Detrended fluctuation analysis and synchronization analysis and their applications to heart rate and respiration during sleep in healthy subjects and patients with sleep disorders are presented. The observed changes can be used to distinguish sleep stages in healthy subjects as well as to differentiate normal and disturbed sleep on the basis of heart rate and respiration recordings without direct recording of brain waves. Of special interest are the cardiovascular consequences of disturbed sleep because they present a risk factor for cardiovascular disorders such as arterial hypertension, cardiac ischemia, sudden cardiac death, and stroke. New derived variables can help to find indicators for these health risks.},

	abstract = {Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), a heterogeneous and multifactorial sleep related breathing disorder with high prevalence, is a recognized risk factor for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Autonomic dysfunction leads to adverse cardiovascular outcomes in diverse pathways. Heart rate is a complex physiological process involving neurovisceral networks and relative regulatory mechanisms such as thermoregulation, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone mechanisms, and metabolic mechanisms. Heart rate variability (HRV) is considered as a reliable and non-invasive measure of autonomic modulation response and adaptation to endogenous and exogenous stimuli. HRV measures may add a new dimension to help understand the interplay between cardiac and nervous system involvement in OSA. The aim of this review is to introduce the various applications of HRV in different aspects of OSA to examine the impaired neuro-cardiac modulation. More specifically, the topics covered include: HRV time windows, sleep staging, arousal, sleepiness, hypoxia, mental illness, and mortality and morbidity. All of these aspects show pathways in the clinical implementation of HRV to screen, diagnose, classify, and predict patients as a reasonable and more convenient alternative to current measures.},

	abstract = {STUDY OBJECTIVES: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is common in commercial motor vehicle operators (CMVOs); however, polysomnography (PSG), the gold-standard diagnostic test, is expensive and inconvenient for screening. OSA is associated with changes in heart rate and voltage on electrocardiography (EKG). We evaluated the utility of EKG parameters in identifying CMVOs at greater risk for sleepiness-related crashes (apnea-hypopnea index [AHI] ≥ 30 events/h).
METHODS: In this prospective study of CMVOs, we performed EKGs with concurrent PSG, and calculated the respiratory power index (RPI) on EKG, a surrogate for AHI calculated from PSG. We evaluated the utility of two-stage predictive models using simple clinical measures (age, body mass index [BMI], neck circumference, Epworth Sleepiness Scale score, and the Multi-Variable Apnea Prediction [MVAP] score) in the first stage, followed by RPI in a subset as the second-stage. We assessed area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), sensitivity, and negative posttest probability (NPTP) for this two-stage approach and for RPI alone.
RESULTS: The best-performing model used the MVAP, which combines BMI, age, and sex with three OSA symptoms, in the first stage, followed by RPI in the second. The model yielded an estimated (95\% confidence interval) AUC of 0.883 (0.767-0.924), sensitivity of 0.917 (0.706-0.962), and NPTP of 0.034 (0.015-0.133). Predictive characteristics were similar using a model with only BMI as the first-stage screen.
CONCLUSIONS: A two-stage model that combines BMI or the MVAP score in the first stage, with EKG in the second, had robust discriminatory power to identify severe OSA in CMVOs.},

	abstract = {Pre-eclampsia (PE), a serious pregnancy-specific disorder, causes significant neonatal and maternal morbidity and mortality. Recent studies showed that cardiovascular variability parameters as well as the baroreflex sensitivity remarkably improve its early diagnosis. For a better understanding of the dynamical changes caused by PE, in this study the coupling between respiration, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and heart rate is investigated. Thirteen datasets of healthy pregnant women and 10 of subjects suffering from PE are included. Nonlinear additive autoregressive models with external input are used for a model-based coupling analysis following the idea of Granger causality. To overcome the problem of misdetections of standard methods in systems with a dominant driver, a heuristic ensemble approach is used here. A coupling is assumed to be real when existent in more than 80 per cent of the ensemble members, and otherwise denoted as artefacts. As the main result, we found that the coupling structure between heart rate, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure and respiration for healthy subjects and PE patients is the same and reliable. As a pathological mechanism, however, a significant increased respiratory influence on the diastolic blood pressure could be found for PE patients (p=0.003). Moreover, the nonlinear form of the respiratory influence on the heart rate is significantly different between the two groups (p=0.002). Interestingly, the influence of systolic blood pressure on the heart rate is not selected, which indicates that the baroreflex sensitivity estimation strongly demands the consideration of causal relationships between heart rate, blood pressure and respiration. Finally, our results point to a potential role of respiration for understanding the pathogenesis of PE.},

Especially, some complexity measures that are based on symbolic dynamics as well as a new measure, the renormalized entropy, detect some abnormalities in the HRV of several patients who have been classified in the low risk group by traditional methods. A combination of these complexity measures with the parameters in the frequency domain seems to be a promising way to get a more precise definition of the individual risk.

Therefore, we consider measure- ments of healthy persons and patients suffering from obstructive sleep apnea syndrome OSAS, with and without hypertension. It is shown that the proposed nonlinear models are capable of describing short-term fluctuations in heart rate as well as systolic blood pressure significantly better than similar linear ones, which confirms the assumption of nonlinear controlled heart rate and blood pressure. Furthermore, the comparison of the nonlinear and linear approaches reveals that the heart rate and blood pressure variability in healthy subjects is caused by a higher level of noise as well as nonlinearity than in patients suffering from OSAS. The residue analysis points at a further source of heart rate and blood pressure variability in healthy subjects, in addition to heart rate, systolic blood pressure, and respiration. Comparison of the nonlinear models within and among the different groups of subjects suggests the ability to discriminate the cohorts that could lead to a stratification of hypertension risk in OSAS patients.},

Therefore, it is challenging to develop sophisticated methods in order to improve medical diagnostics. The question whether the normal heart rate is chaotic or not is an attempt to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of cardiovascular dynamics and therefore a highly controversial topical challenge. In this contribution we demonstrate that linear and nonlinear parameters allow us to separate completely the data sets of the three groups provided for this controversial topic in nonlinear dynamics. The question whether these time series are chaotic or not cannot be answered satisfactorily without investigating the underlying mechanisms leading to them. We give an example of the dominant influence of respiration on heart beat dynamics, which shows that observed fluctuations can be mostly explained by respiratory modulations of heart rate and blood pressure (coefficient of determination: 96\%). Therefore, we recommend reformulating the following initial question: "Is the normal heart rate chaotic?" We rather ask the following: "Is the normal heart rate 'chaotic' due to respiration?"},

	abstract = {The performance of (bio-)signal classification strongly depends on the choice of suitable features (also called parameters or biomarkers). In this article we evaluate the discriminative power of ordinal pattern statistics and symbolic dynamics in comparison with established heart rate variability parameters applied to beat-to-beat intervals. As an illustrative example we distinguish patients suffering from congestive heart failure from a (healthy) control group using beat-to-beat time series. We assess the discriminative power of individual features as well as pairs of features. These comparisons show that ordinal patterns sampled with an additional time lag are promising features for efficient classification.},

	abstract = {Sleep is a complex regulated process with short periods of wakefulness and different sleep stages. These sleep stages modulate autonomous functions such as blood pressure and heart rate. The method of symbolic coupling traces (SCT) is used to analyze and quantify time-delayed coupling of these measurements during different sleep stages. The symbolic coupling traces, defined as the symmetric and diametric traces of the bivariate word distribution matrix, allow the quantification of time-delayed coupling. In this paper, the method is applied to heart rate and systolic blood pressure time series during different sleep stages for healthy controls as well as for normotensive and hypertensive patients with sleep apneas. Using the SCT, significant different cardiovascular mechanisms not only between the deep sleep and the other sleep stages but also between healthy subjects and patients can be revealed. The SCT method is applied to model systems, compared with established methods, such as cross correlation, mutual information, and cross recurrence analysis and demonstrates its advantages especially for nonstationary physiological data. As a result, SCT proves to be more specific in detecting delays of directional interactions than standard coupling analysis methods and yields additional information which cannot be measured by standard parameters of heart rate and blood pressure variability. The proposed method may help to indicate the pathological changes in cardiovascular regulation and also the effects of continuous positive airway pressure therapy on the cardiovascular system.},

	abstract = {Preeclampsia is one of the main sources of morbidity in pregnancy with a high mortality rate without a known ultimate cause. Using a corpus including 927 measurements of pregnant women with and without different hypertonic diseases at multiple stages of pregnancy, we utilised a new approach to analyse cardiorespiratory coordination. Since the recording quality of respiratory effort was limited due to a high signal to noise ratio, we applied an ECG derived respiration approach to create an ersatz respiratory signal. After applying the few available recordings with a sufficiently high quality of the respiratory signal to validate the substitute, coordigrams were calculated and quantified by utilising the epsilon method. We showed significant (p = 0.02) differences in the coordination between healthy and preeclampsia subjects in a matched (BMI, age, gestational week) comparison of preeclampsia and healthy subjects. Hopefully future applications of and improvements on these methods are able to create a fast and convenient prediction methodology to reduce the impact of this disease as well as help in the determination of its underlying cause.},
